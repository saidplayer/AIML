       "'Be yourself; everyone else is already taken. I\\'m selfish, impatient and a little insecure. I make mistakes, I am out of control and at times hard to handle. But if you can\\'t handle me at my worst, then you sure as hell don\\'t deserve me at my best. Two things are infinite: the universe and human stupidity; and I\\'m not sure about the universe. So many books, so little time. A room without books is like a body without a soul. Be who you are and say what you feel, because those who mind don\\'t matter, and those who matter don\\'t mind. You\\'ve gotta dance like there\\'s nobody watching,Love like you\\'ll never be hurt,Sing like there\\'s nobody listening,And live like it\\'s heaven on earth. You know you\\'re in love when you can\\'t fall asleep because reality is finally better than your dreams. You only live once, but if you do it right, once is enough. Be the change that you wish to see in the world. In three words I can sum up everything I\\'ve learned about life: it goes on. If you want to know what a man\\'s like, take a good look at how he treats his inferiors, not his equals. Donâ€™t walk in front of meâ€¦ I may not followDonâ€™t walk behind meâ€¦ I may not leadWalk beside meâ€¦ just be my friend If you tell the truth, you don\\'t have to remember anything. Friendship ... is born at the moment when one man says to another \"What! You too? I thought that no one but myself . . . A friend is someone who knows all about you and still loves you. Always forgive your enemies; nothing annoys them so much. To live is the rarest thing in the world. Most people exist, that is all. Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever. Darkness cannot drive out darkness: only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate: only love can do that. Without music, life would be a mistake. We accept the love we think we deserve. I am so clever that sometimes I don\\'t understand a single word of what I am saying. To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment. Here\\'s to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently. They\\'re not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. About the only thing you can\\'t do is ignore them. Because they change things. They push the human race forward. And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do. Insanity is doing the same thing, over and over again, but expecting different results. I believe that everything happens for a reason. People change so that you can learn to let go, things go wrong so that you appreciate them when they\\'re right, you believe lies so you eventually learn to trust no one but yourself, and sometimes good things fall apart so better things can fall together. Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn\\'t do than by the ones you did do. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover. It is better to be hated for what you are than to be loved for what you are not. Only once in your life, I truly believe, you find someone who can completely turn your world around. You tell them things that youâ€™ve never shared with another soul and they absorb everything you say and actually want to hear more. You share hopes for the future, dreams that will never come true, goals that were never achieved and the many disappointments life has thrown at you. When something wonderful happens, you canâ€™t wait to tell them about it, knowing they will share in your excitement. They are not embarrassed to cry with you when you are hurting or laugh with you when you make a fool of yourself. Never do they hurt your feelings or make you feel like you are not good enough, but rather they build you up and show you the things about yourself that make you special and even beautiful. There is never any pressure, jealousy or competition but only a quiet calmness when they are around. You can be yourself and not worry about what they will think of you because they love you for who you are. The things that seem insignificant to most people such as a note, song or walk become invaluable treasures kept safe in your heart to cherish forever. Memories of your childhood come back and are so clear and vivid itâ€™s like being young again. Colours seem brighter and more brilliant. Laughter seems part of daily life where before it was infrequent or didnâ€™t exist at all. A phone call or two during the day helps to get you through a long dayâ€™s work and always brings a smile to your face. In their presence, thereâ€™s no need for continuous conversation, but you find youâ€™re quite content in just having them nearby. Things that never interested you before become fascinating because you know they are important to this person who is so special to you. You think of this person on every occasion and in everything you do. Simple things bring them to mind like a pale blue sky, gentle wind or even a storm cloud on the horizon. You open your heart knowing that thereâ€™s a chance it may be broken one day and in opening your heart, you experience a love and joy that you never dreamed possible. You find that being vulnerable is the only way to allow your heart to feel true pleasure thatâ€™s so real it scares you. You find strength in knowing you have a true friend and possibly a soul mate who will remain loyal to the end. Life seems completely different, exciting and worthwhile. Your only hope and security is in knowing that they are a part of your life. All that is gold does not glitter,Not all those who wander are lost;The old that is strong does not wither,Deep roots are not reached by the frost.From the ashes a fire shall be woken,A light from the shadows shall spring;Renewed shall be blade that was broken,The crownless again shall be king. It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities. The person, be it gentleman or lady, who has not pleasure in a good novel, must be intolerably stupid. Imperfection is beauty, madness is genius and it\\'s better to be absolutely ridiculous than absolutely boring. There are only two ways to live your life. One is as though nothing is a miracle. The other is as though everything is a miracle. It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live. Good friends, good books, and a sleepy conscience: this is the ideal life. As he read, I fell in love the way you fall asleep: slowly, and then all at once. We are all in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars. Fairy tales are more than true: not because they tell us that dragons exist, but because they tell us that dragons can be beaten. It is better to remain silent at the risk of being thought a fool, than to talk and remove all doubt of it. The fool doth think he is wise, but the wise man knows himself to be a fool. Whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority, it is time to reform (or pause and reflect). Life is what happens to us while we are making other plans. Yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery, today is a gift of God, which is why we call it the present. I have not failed. I\\'ve just found 10,000 ways that won\\'t work. It is not a lack of love, but a lack of friendship that makes unhappy marriages. The opposite of love is not hate, it\\'s indifference. The opposite of art is not ugliness, it\\'s indifference. The opposite of faith is not heresy, it\\'s indifference. And the opposite of life is not death, it\\'s indifference. A woman is like a tea bag; you never know how strong it is until it\\'s in hot water. The man who does not read has no advantage over the man who cannot read. If you don\\'t stand for something you will fall for anything. I may not have gone where I intended to go, but I think I have ended up where I needed to be. I love you without knowing how, or when, or from where. I love you simply, without problems or pride: I love you in this way because I do not know any other way of loving but this, in which there is no I or you, so intimate that your hand upon my chest is my hand, so intimate that when I fall asleep your eyes close. I solemnly swear that I am up to no good. Outside of a dog, a book is man\\'s best friend. Inside of a dog it\\'s too dark to read. I am enough of an artist to draw freely upon my imagination. Imagination is more important than knowledge. Knowledge is limited. Imagination encircles the world. Love all, trust a few, do wrong to none. I like nonsense, it wakes up the brain cells. Fantasy is a necessary ingredient in living. Have you ever been in love? Horrible isn\\'t it? It makes you so vulnerable. It opens your chest and it opens up your heart and it means that someone can get inside you and mess you up. A day without sunshine is like, you know, night. A reader lives a thousand lives before he dies, said Jojen. The man who never reads lives only one. Never put off till tomorrow what may be done day after tomorrow just as well.  You have brains in your head. You have feet in your shoes. You can steer yourself any direction you choose. You\\'re on your own. And you know what you know. And YOU are the one who\\'ll decide where to go... That which does not kill us makes us stronger. Being deeply loved by someone gives you strength, while loving someone deeply gives you courage. It is never too late to be what you might have been. For every minute you are angry you lose sixty seconds of happiness. It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends. This life is what you make it. No matter what, you\\'re going to mess up sometimes, it\\'s a universal truth. But the good part is you get to decide how you\\'re going to mess it up. Girls will be your friends - they\\'ll act like it anyway. But just remember, some come, some go. The ones that stay with you through everything - they\\'re your true best friends. Don\\'t let go of them. Also remember, sisters make the best friends in the world. As for lovers, well, they\\'ll come and go too. And baby, I hate to say it, most of them - actually pretty much all of them are going to break your heart, but you can\\'t give up because if you give up, you\\'ll never find your soulmate. You\\'ll never find that half who makes you whole and that goes for everything. Just because you fail once, doesn\\'t mean you\\'re gonna fail at everything. Keep trying, hold on, and always, always, always believe in yourself, because if you don\\'t, then who will, sweetie? So keep your head high, keep your chin up, and most importantly, keep smiling, because life\\'s a beautiful thing and there\\'s so much to smile about. I love deadlines. I love the whooshing noise they make as they go by. If you judge people, you have no time to love them. There is never a time or place for true love. It happens accidentally, in a heartbeat, in a single flashing, throbbing moment. If you can\\'t explain it to a six year old, you don\\'t understand it yourself. I\\'m not upset that you lied to me, I\\'m upset that from now on I can\\'t believe you. There is no greater agony than bearing an untold story inside you. Love is that condition in which the happiness of another person is essential to your own. Anyone who thinks sitting in church can make you a Christian must also think that sitting in a garage can make you a car. If you only read the books that everyone else is reading, you can only think what everyone else is thinking. I have always imagined that Paradise will be a kind of library. Everything you can imagine is real. Women and cats will do as they please, and men and dogs should relax and get used to the idea. Sometimes the questions are complicated and the answers are simple. You may not be her first, her last, or her only. She loved before she may love again. But if she loves you now, what else matters? She\\'s not perfectâ€you aren\\'t either, and the two of you may never be perfect together but if she can make you laugh, cause you to think twice, and admit to being human and making mistakes, hold onto her and give her the most you can. She may not be thinking about you every second of the day, but she will give you a part of her that she knows you can breakâ€her heart. So don\\'t hurt her, don\\'t change her, don\\'t analyze and don\\'t expect more than she can give. Smile when she makes you happy, let her know when she makes you mad, and miss her when she\\'s not there. Never trust anyone who has not brought a book with them. You love me. Real or not real?\"I tell him, \"Real. You can never get a cup of tea large enough or a book long enough to suit me. We read to know we\\'re not alone. Sometimes, you read a book and it fills you with this weird evangelical zeal, and you become convinced that the shattered world will never be put back together unless and until all living humans read the book. All you need is love. But a little chocolate now and then doesn\\'t hurt. Of course it is happening inside your head, Harry, but why on earth should that mean that it is not real? Beauty is in the eye of the beholder and it may be necessary from time to time to give a stupid or misinformed beholder a black eye. Life isn\\'t about finding yourself. Life is about creating yourself. Today you are You, that is truer than true. There is no one alive who is Youer than You. To the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure. I\\'m not afraid of death; I just don\\'t want to be there when it happens. If one cannot enjoy reading a book over and over again, there is no use in reading it at all. If you want your children to be intelligent, read them fairy tales. If you want them to be more intelligent, read them more fairy tales. Have you fallen in love with the wrong person yet?\\'Jace said, \"Unfortunately, Lady of the Haven, my one true love remains myself.\"...\"At least,\" she said, \"you don\\'t have to worry about rejection, Jace Wayland.\"\"Not necessarily. I turn myself down occasionally, just to keep it interesting. Logic will get you from A to Z; imagination will get you everywhere. I\\'m in love with you,\" he said quietly.\"Augustus,\" I said.\"I am,\" he said. He was staring at me, and I could see the corners of his eyes crinkling. \"I\\'m in love with you, and I\\'m not in the business of denying myself the simple pleasure of saying true things. I\\'m in love with you, and I know that love is just a shout into the void, and that oblivion is inevitable, and that we\\'re all doomed and that there will come a day when all our labor has been returned to dust, and I know the sun will swallow the only earth we\\'ll ever have, and I am in love with you. Whenever I feel the need to exercise, I lie down until it goes away. I am nothing special, of this I am sure. I am a common man with common thoughts and I\\'ve led a common life. There are no monuments dedicated to me and my name will soon be forgotten, but I\\'ve loved another with all my heart and soul, and to me, this has always been enough.. Sometimes people are beautiful.Not in looks.Not in what they say.Just in what they are. You don\\'t get to choose if you get hurt in this world...but you do have some say in who hurts you. I like my choices. The truth is, everyone is going to hurt you. You just got to find the ones worth suffering for. The more that you read, the more things you will know. The more that you learn, the more places you\\'ll go. Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind,And therefore is winged Cupid painted blind. Folks are usually about as happy as they make their minds up to be. Do what you can, with what you have, where you are. There is no friend as loyal as a book. One good thing about music, when it hits you, you feel no pain. I find television very educating. Every time somebody turns on the set, I go into the other room and read a book. The story so far:In the beginning the Universe was created.This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move. Not all of us can do great things. But we can do small things with great love. Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts. Love is like the wind, you can\\'t see it but you can feel it. Listen to the mustn\\'ts, child. Listen to the don\\'ts. Listen to the shouldn\\'ts, the impossibles, the won\\'ts. Listen to the never haves, then listen close to me... Anything can happen, child. Anything can be. When one door of happiness closes, another opens; but often we look so long at the closed door that we do not see the one which has been opened for us. If you live to be a hundred, I want to live to be a hundred minus one day so I never have to live without you. So, this is my life. And I want you to know that I am both happy and sad and I\\'m still trying to figure out how that could be. Saying \\'I notice you\\'re a nerd\\' is like saying, \\'Hey, I notice that you\\'d rather be intelligent than be stupid, that you\\'d rather be thoughtful than be vapid, that you believe that there are things that matter more than the arrest record of Lindsay Lohan. Why is that?\\' In fact, it seems to me that most contemporary insults are pretty lame. Even \\'lame\\' is kind of lame. Saying \\'You\\'re lame\\' is like saying \\'You walk with a limp.\\' Yeah, whatever, so does 50 Cent, and he\\'s done all right for himself. People think a soul mate is your perfect fit, and that\\'s what everyone wants. But a true soul mate is a mirror, the person who shows you everything that is holding you back, the person who brings you to your own attention so you can change your life. A true soul mate is probably the most important person you\\'ll ever meet, because they tear down your walls and smack you awake. But to live with a soul mate forever? Nah. Too painful. Soul mates, they come into your life just to reveal another layer of yourself to you, and then leave. A soul mates purpose is to shake you up, tear apart your ego a little bit, show you your obstacles and addictions, break your heart open so new light can get in, make you so desperate and out of control that you have to transform your life, then introduce you to your spiritual master... It matters not what someone is born, but what they grow to be. Life is like riding a bicycle. To keep your balance, you must keep moving. There is nothing I would not do for those who are really my friends. I have no notion of loving people by halves, it is not my nature. You don\\'t love someone because they\\'re perfect, you love them in spite of the fact that they\\'re not. Some people never go crazy. What truly horrible lives they must lead. The difference between genius and stupidity is: genius has its limits. Love never dies a natural death. It dies because we don\\'t know how to replenish its source. It dies of blindness and errors and betrayals. It dies of illness and wounds; it dies of weariness, of witherings, of tarnishings. What really knocks me out is a book that, when you\\'re all done reading it, you wish the author that wrote it was a terrific friend of yours and you could call him up on the phone whenever you felt like it. That doesn\\'t happen much, though. If you can make a woman laugh, you can make her do anything. Weâ€™re all a little weird. And life is a little weird. And when we find someone whose weirdness is compatible with ours, we join up with them and fall into mutually satisfying weirdnessâ€and call it loveâ€true love. You donâ€™t have a soul, Doctor. You are a soul. You have a body, temporarily. I would venture to guess that Anon, who wrote so many poems without signing them, was often a woman. Some infinities are bigger than other infinities. Do one thing every day that scares you. It is what you read when you don\\'t have to that determines what you will be when you can\\'t help it. The trouble with having an open mind, of course, is that people will insist on coming along and trying to put things in it. If I had a flower for every time I thought of you...I could walk through my garden forever. One must always be careful of books,\" said Tessa, \"and what is inside them, for words have the power to change us. Not all those who wander are lost. Time you enjoy wasting is not wasted time. Reality continues to ruin my life. Things change. And friends leave. Life doesn\\'t stop for anybody. There is no pretending,\" Jace said with absolute clarity. \"I love you, and I will love you until I die, and if there is life after that, I\\'ll love you then. Who are you to judge the life I live?I know I\\'m not perfect-and I don\\'t live to be-but before you start pointing fingers...make sure you hands are clean! The real lover is the man who can thrill you by kissing your forehead or smiling into your eyes or just staring into space. If there\\'s a book that you want to read, but it hasn\\'t been written yet, then you must write it. Piglet sidled up to Pooh from behind. \"Pooh!\" he whispered.\"Yes, Piglet?\"\"Nothing,\" said Piglet, taking Pooh\\'s paw. \"I just wanted to be sure of you. To love at all is to be vulnerable. Love anything and your heart will be wrung and possibly broken. If you want to make sure of keeping it intact you must give it to no one, not even an animal. Wrap it carefully round with hobbies and little luxuries; avoid all entanglements. Lock it up safe in the casket or coffin of your selfishness. But in that casket, safe, dark, motionless, airless, it will change. It will not be broken; it will become unbreakable, impenetrable, irredeemable. To love is to be vulnerable. The only way out of the labyrinth of suffering is to forgive. He\\'s like a drug for you, Bella. Do not pity the dead, Harry. Pity the living, and, above all those who live without love. The reason I talk to myself is because Iâ€™m the only one whose answers I accept. A wise girl kisses but doesn\\'t love, listens but doesn\\'t believe, and leaves before she is left. Go to heaven for the climate and hell for the company. I wish it need not have happened in my time,\" said Frodo.\"So do I,\" said Gandalf, \"and so do all who live to see such times. But that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us. When someone loves you, the way they talk about you is different. You feel safe and comfortable. Dumbledore watched her fly away, and as her silvery glow faded he turned back to Snape, and his eyes were full of tears.\"After all this time?\"\"Always,\" said Snape. There is nothing to writing. All you do is sit down at a typewriter and bleed. I declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading! How much sooner one tires of any thing than of a book! -- When I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I have not an excellent library. And, when you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it. I am good, but not an angel. I do sin, but I am not the devil. I am just a small girl in a big world trying to find someone to love. He has achieved success who has lived well, laughed often, and loved much;Who has enjoyed the trust of pure women, the respect of intelligent men and the love of little children;Who has filled his niche and accomplished his task;Who has never lacked appreciation of Earth\\'s beauty or failed to express it;Who has left the world better than he found it,Whether an improved poppy, a perfect poem, or a rescued soul;Who has always looked for the best in others and given them the best he had;Whose life was an inspiration;Whose memory a benediction. You may say I\\'m a dreamer, but I\\'m not the only one. I hope someday you\\'ll join us. And the world will live as one. I\\'ve been making a list of the things they don\\'t teach you at school. They don\\'t teach you how to love somebody. They don\\'t teach you how to be famous. They don\\'t teach you how to be rich or how to be poor. They don\\'t teach you how to walk away from someone you don\\'t love any longer. They don\\'t teach you how to know what\\'s going on in someone else\\'s mind. They don\\'t teach you what to say to someone who\\'s dying. They don\\'t teach you anything worth knowing. â€²Classicâ€² - a book which people praise and don\\'t read. I love mankind ... it\\'s people I can\\'t stand!! You donâ€™t forget the face of the person who was your last hope. I am free of all prejudice. I hate everyone equally.  Finish each day and be done with it. You have done what you could. Some blunders and absurdities no doubt crept in; forget them as soon as you can. Tomorrow is a new day. You shall begin it serenely and with too high a spirit to be encumbered with your old nonsense. I have never let my schooling interfere with my education. The books that the world calls immoral are books that show the world its own shame. The marks humans leave are too often scars. You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view... Until you climb inside of his skin and walk around in it. Remember, we\\'re madly in love, so it\\'s all right to kiss me anytime you feel like it. A lady\\'s imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love to matrimony in a moment. To die will be an awfully big adventure. Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, \\'Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous?\\' Actually, who are you not to be? You are a child of God. Your playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won\\'t feel insecure around you. We are all meant to shine, as children do. We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us. It\\'s not just in some of us; it\\'s in everyone. And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others. Anyone who has never made a mistake has never tried anything new. Some day you will be old enough to start reading fairy tales again. We are what we pretend to be, so we must be careful about what we pretend to be. It takes courage to grow up and become who you really are. Itâ€™s no use going back to yesterday, because I was a different person then. And in that moment, I swear we were infinite. Books are a uniquely portable magic. You have to write the book that wants to be written. And if the book will be too difficult for grown-ups, then you write it for children. I\\'m the one that\\'s got to die when it\\'s time for me to die, so let me live my life the way I want to. I can never read all the books I want; I can never be all the people I want and live all the lives I want. I can never train myself in all the skills I want. And why do I want? I want to live and feel all the shades, tones and variations of mental and physical experience possible in my life. And I am horribly limited. But better to get hurt by the truth than comforted with a lie. Books are the ultimate Dumpees: put them down and theyâ€™ll wait for you forever; pay attention to them and they always love you back. We believe in ordinary acts of bravery, in the courage that drives one person to stand up for another. There is nothing better than a friend, unless it is a friend with chocolate. So it\\'s not gonna be easy. It\\'s going to be really hard; we\\'re gonna have to work at this everyday, but I want to do that because I want you. I want all of you, forever, everyday. You and me... everyday. The truth is rarely pure and never simple. There are infinite numbers between 0 and 1. There\\'s .1 and .12 and .112 and an infinite collection of others. Of course, there is a bigger infinite set of numbers between 0 and 2, or between 0 and a million. Some infinities are bigger than other infinities. A writer we used to like taught us that. There are days, many of them, when I resent the size of my unbounded set. I want more numbers than I\\'m likely to get, and God, I want more numbers for Augustus Waters than he got. But, Gus, my love, I cannot tell you how thankful I am for our little infinity. I wouldn\\'t trade it for the world. You gave me a forever within the numbered days, and I\\'m grateful. ... a mind needs books as a sword needs a whetstone, if it is to keep its edge. The truth.\" Dumbledore sighed. \"It is a beautiful and terrible thing, and should therefore be treated with great caution. I believe in Christianity as I believe that the sun has risen: not only because I see it, but because by it I see everything else. The fear of death follows from the fear of life. A man who lives fully is prepared to die at any time. Remember, if the time should come when you have to make a choice between what is right and what is easy, remember what happened to a boy who was good, and kind, and brave, because he strayed across the path of Lord Voldemort. Remember Cedric Diggory. Memories warm you up from the inside. But they also tear you apart. A lie can travel half way around the world while the truth is putting on its shoes. Never tell the truth to people who are not worthy of it. Be nice to nerds. You may end up working for them. We all could. Just when you think it can\\'t get any worse, it can. And just when you think it can\\'t get any better, it can. Tis better to have loved and lostThan never to have loved at all. Knowing yourself is the beginning of all wisdom. It\\'s so hard to forget pain, but it\\'s even harder to remember sweetness. We have no scar to show for happiness. We learn so little from peace. I love you as certain dark things are to be loved, in secret, between the shadow and the soul. Do you remember me telling you we are practicing non-verbal spells, Potter?\"\"Yes,\" said Harry stiffly.\"Yes, sir.\"\"There\\'s no need to call me \"sir\" Professor.\"The words had escaped him before he knew what he was saying. Only the very weak-minded refuse to be influenced by literature and poetry. It\\'s the possibility of having a dream come true that makes life interesting. Be not afraid of greatness. Some are born great, some achieve greatness, and others have greatness thrust upon them. What you\\'re supposed to do when you don\\'t like a thing is change it. If you can\\'t change it, change the way you think about it. Don\\'t complain. Happiness in intelligent people is the rarest thing I know. A day without laughter is a day wasted. Heâ€™s not perfect. You arenâ€™t either, and the two of you will never be perfect. But if he can make you laugh at least once, causes you to think twice, and if he admits to being human and making mistakes, hold onto him and give him the most you can. He isnâ€™t going to quote poetry, heâ€™s not thinking about you every moment, but he will give you a part of him that he knows you could break. Donâ€™t hurt him, donâ€™t change him, and donâ€™t expect for more than he can give. Donâ€™t analyze. Smile when he makes you happy, yell when he makes you mad, and miss him when heâ€™s not there. Love hard when there is love to be had. Because perfect guys donâ€™t exist, but thereâ€™s always one guy that is perfect for you. A person\\'s a person, no matter how small. The only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing. Perhaps one did not want to be loved so much as to be understood. Yes: I am a dreamer. For a dreamer is one who can only find his way by moonlight, and his punishment is that he sees the dawn before the rest of the world. When adults say, \"Teenagers think they are invincible\" with that sly, stupid smile on their faces, they don\\'t know how right they are. We need never be hopeless, because we can never be irreparably broken. We think that we are invincible because we are. We cannot be born, and we cannot die. Like all energy, we can only change shapes and sizes and manifestations. They forget that when they get old. They get scared of losing and failing. But that part of us greater than the sum of our parts cannot begin and cannot end, and so it cannot fail. I became insane, with long intervals of horrible sanity. Oh, I wouldn\\'t mind, Hazel Grace. It would be a privilege to have my heart broken by you. Jesus!\" Luke exclaimed.\"Actually, it\\'s just me,\" said Simon. \"Although I\\'ve been told the resemblance is startling. When we honestly ask ourselves which person in our lives mean the most to us, we often find that it is those who, instead of giving advice, solutions, or cures, have chosen rather to share our pain and touch our wounds with a warm and tender hand. The friend who can be silent with us in a moment of despair or confusion, who can stay with us in an hour of grief and bereavement, who can tolerate not knowing, not curing, not healing and face with us the reality of our powerlessness, that is a friend who cares. Numbing the pain for a while will make it worse when you finally feel it. I finally understood what true love meant...love meant that you care for another person\\'s happiness more than your own, no matter how painful the choices you face might be. You can never be overdressed or overeducated. Just because you have the emotional range of a teaspoon doesn\\'t mean we all have. It is one of the blessings of old friends that you can afford to be stupid with them. The one you love and the one who loves you are never, ever the same person. Be careful about reading health books. Some fine day you\\'ll die of a misprint. Have you ever noticed how â€˜What the hellâ€™ is always the right decision to make? Books are the quietest and most constant of friends; they are the most accessible and wisest of counselors, and the most patient of teachers. You can\\'t live your life for other people. You\\'ve got to do what\\'s right for you, even if it hurts some people you love. An eye for an eye will only make the whole world blind. If you\\'re gonna be two-faced at least make one of them pretty. Until I feared I would lose it, I never loved to read. One does not love breathing. The saddest aspect of life right now is that science gathers knowledge faster than society gathers wisdom. I would rather walk with a friend in the dark, than alone in the light. So I walked back to my room and collapsed on the bottom bunk, thinking that if people were rain, I was drizzle and she was a hurricane. Music expresses that which cannot be put into words and that which cannot remain silent I speak to everyone in the same way, whether he is the garbage man or the president of the university. A great book should leave you with many experiences, and slightly exhausted at the end. You live several lives while reading. The truth will set you free, but first it will piss you off. Do you hate people?â€�â€œI don\\'t hate them...I just feel better when they\\'re not around. Creativity is knowing how to hide your sources How wonderful it is that nobody need wait a single moment before starting to improve the world. I am no bird; and no net ensnares me: I am a free human being with an independent will. Fate is like a strange, unpopular restaurant filled with odd little waiters who bring you things you never asked for and don\\'t always like. Is this the part where you start tearing off strips of your shirt to bind my wounds?\"\"If you wanted me to rip my clothes off, you should have just asked. A children\\'s story that can only be enjoyed by children is not a good children\\'s story in the slightest. The Seven Social Sins are: Wealth without work. Pleasure without conscience. Knowledge without character. Commerce without morality. Science without humanity. Worship without sacrifice. Politics without principle.From a sermon given by Frederick Lewis Donaldson in Westminster Abbey, London, on March 20, 1925. You will never be happy if you continue to search for what happiness consists of. You will never live if you are looking for the meaning of life. If you don\\'t have time to read, you don\\'t have the time (or the tools) to write. Simple as that. When we love, we always strive to become better than we are. When we strive to become better than we are, everything around us becomes better too. I wish I could freeze this moment, right here, right now and live in it forever. The statistics on sanity are that one out of every four people is suffering from a mental illness. Look at your 3 best friends. If they\\'re ok, then it\\'s you. Life is an awful, ugly place to not have a best friend. Happiness is when what you think, what you say, and what you do are in harmony. Keep away from people who try to belittle your ambitions. Small people always do that, but the really great make you feel that you, too, can become great. Never forget what you are, for surely the world will not. Make it your strength. Then it can never be your weakness. Armour yourself in it, and it will never be used to hurt you. I don\\'t want to be a man,\" said Jace. \"I want to be an angst-ridden teenager who can\\'t confront his own inner demons and takes it out verbally on other people instead.\"\"Well,\" said Luke, \"you\\'re doing a fantastic job. I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain. I no longer believed in the idea of soul mates, or love at first sight. But I was beginning to believe that a very few times in your life, if you were lucky, you might meet someone who was exactly right for you. Not because he was perfect, or because you were, but because your combined flaws were arranged in a way that allowed two separate beings to hinge together. Well-behaved women seldom make history. Give a man a fire and he\\'s warm for a day, but set fire to him and he\\'s warm for the rest of his life. We\\'re all human, aren\\'t we? Every human life is worth the same, and worth saving. With great power... comes great need to take a nap. Wake me up later. Being a woman is a terribly difficult trade since it consists principally of dealings with men. One is loved because one is loved. No reason is needed for loving. Everyone thinks of changing the world, but no one thinks of changing himself. If we find ourselves with a desire that nothing in this world can satisfy, the most probable explanation is that we were made for another world. It\\'s the friends you can call up at 4 a.m. that matter. Becoming fearless isn\\'t the point. That\\'s impossible. It\\'s learning how to control your fear, and how to be free from it. The Road Not TakenTwo roads diverged in a yellow wood,And sorry I could not travel both\\tAnd be one traveler, long I stood\\tAnd looked down one as far as I could\\tTo where it bent in the undergrowth;\\t  Then took the other, as just as fair,\\tAnd having perhaps the better claim,\\tBecause it was grassy and wanted wear;\\tThough as for that the passing there\\tHad worn them really about the same,\\t  And both that morning equally lay\\tIn leaves no step had trodden black.\\tOh, I kept the first for another day!\\tYet knowing how way leads on to way,\\tI doubted if I should ever come back.\\t  I shall be telling this with a sigh\\tSomewhere ages and ages hence:\\tTwo roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€\\tI took the one less traveled by,\\tAnd that has made all the difference. And above all, watch with glittering eyes the whole world around you because the greatest secrets are always hidden in the most unlikely places. Those who don\\'t believe in magic will never find it. So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past. I don\\'t know half of you half as well as I should like; and I like less than half of you half as well as you deserve. Lock up your libraries if you like; but there is no gate, no lock, no bolt that you can set upon the freedom of my mind. When I despair, I remember that all through history the way of truth and love have always won. There have been tyrants and murderers, and for a time, they can seem invincible, but in the end, they always fall. Think of it--always. It\\'s far better to be unhappy alone than unhappy with someone â€ so far. There\\'s nothing like deep breaths after laughing that hard. Nothing in the world like a sore stomach for the right reasons. I am not pretty. I am not beautiful. I am as radiant as the sun. Every man has his secret sorrows which the world knows not; and often times we call a man cold when he is only sad. If you don\\'t know where you\\'re going, any road\\'ll take you there Let me tell you this: if you meet a loner, no matter what they tell you, it\\'s not because they enjoy solitude. It\\'s because they have tried to blend into the world before, and people continue to disappoint them. You can love someone so much...But you can never love people as much as you can miss them. In vain have I struggled. It will not do. My feelings will not be repressed. You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you. Nothing is impossible, the word itself says \\'I\\'m possible\\'! All God does is watch us and kill us when we get boring. We must never, ever be boring. You don\\'t have to burn books to destroy a culture. Just get people to stop reading them. There is only one thing that makes a dream impossible to achieve: the fear of failure. We love the things we love for what they are. Love is needing someone. Love is putting up with someone\\'s bad qualities because they somehow complete you. Perhaps all the dragons in our lives are princesses who are only waiting to see us act, just once, with beauty and courage. Perhaps everything that frightens us is, in its deepest essence, something helpless that wants our love. It takes ten times as long to put yourself back together as it does to fall apart. I would die for you. But I won\\'t live for you. Do what you feel in your heart to be right â€ for youâ€™ll be criticized anyway. Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. I can\\'t give you a sure-fire formula for success, but I can give you a formula for failure: try to please everybody all the time. [...]the only people for me are the mad ones, the ones who are mad to live, mad to talk, mad to be saved, desirous of everything at the same time, the ones who never yawn or say a commonplace thing, but burn, burn, burn like fabulous yellow roman candles exploding like spiders across the stars and in the middle you see the blue centerlight pop and everybody goes â€œAwww! This lifeâ€™s hard, but itâ€™s harder if youâ€™re stupid. I refuse to answer that question on the grounds that I don\\'t know the answer Sometimes I can hear my bones straining under the weight of all the lives I\\'m not living. What a treacherous thing to believe that a person is more than a person. Never love anyone who treats you like you\\'re ordinary. Maybe our favorite quotations say more about us than about the stories and people we\\'re quoting. So, I love you because the entire universe conspired to help me find you. Wit beyond measure is manâ€™s greatest treasure. Sometimes you wake up. Sometimes the fall kills you. And sometimes, when you fall, you fly. Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed, citizens can change the world. Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has. Most people are other people. Their thoughts are someone else\\'s opinions, their lives a mimicry, their passions a quotation. Death ends a life, not a relationship. Happiness is not something ready made. It comes from your own actions. Count your age by friends, not years. Count your life by smiles, not tears. We are only as strong as we are united, as weak as we are divided. If you were half as funny as you think you are, you\\'d be twice as funny as you really are. I carry your heart with me (I carry it in my heart)I am never without it (anywhereI go you go,my dear; and whatever is done by only me is your doing,my darling)I fear no fate (for you are my fate,my sweet)I want no world (for beautiful you are my world,my true)and it\\'s you are whatever a moon has always meant and whatever a sun will always sing is youhere is the deepest secret nobody knows(here is the root of the root and the bud of the bud and the sky of the sky of a tree called life; which growshigher than the soul can hope or mind can hide)and this is the wonder that\\'s keeping the stars apartI carry your heart (I carry it in my heart) Hold fast to dreams,For if dreams dieLife is a broken-winged bird,That cannot fly. Never memorize something that you can look up. Indifference and neglect often do much more damage than outright dislike. The weak can never forgive. Forgiveness is the attribute of the strong. All that we see or seem is but a dream within a dream. Peace begins with a smile.. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us. The Christian does not think God will love us because we are good, but that God will make us good because He loves us. Do not read, as children do, to amuse yourself, or like the ambitious, for the purpose of instruction. No, read in order to live. I like the night. Without the dark, we\\'d never see the stars. We came to see Jace. Is he alright?\"\"I don\\'t know,\" Magnus said. \"Does he normally just lie on the floor like that without moving? The only thing worse than a boy who hates you: a boy that loves you. Imagining the future is a kind of nostalgia. (...) You spend your whole life stuck in the labyrinth, thinking about how you\\'ll escape it one day, and how awesome it will be, and imagining that future keeps you going, but you never do it. You just use the future to escape the present. Is it true that you shouted at Professor Umbridge?\"\"Yes.\"\"You called her a liar?\"\"Yes.\"\"You told her He Who Must Not Be Named is back?\"\"Yes.\"\"Have a biscuit, Potter. Mr. Moony presents his compliments to Professor Snape, and begs him to keep his abnormally large nose out of other people\\'s business.Mr. Prongs agrees with Mr. Moony, and would like to add that Professor Snape is an ugly git.Mr. Padfoot would like to register his astonishment that an idiot like that ever became a professor.Mr. Wormtail bids Professor Snape good day, and advises him to wash his hair, the slimeball. You talk when you cease to be at peace with your thoughts. So, I guess we are who we are for alot of reasons. And maybe we\\'ll never know most of them. But even if we don\\'t have the power to choose where we come from, we can still choose where we go from there. We can still do things. And we can try to feel okay about them. You\\'re going to come across people in your life who will say all the right words at all the right times. But in the end, it\\'s always their actions you should judge them by. It\\'s actions, not words, that matter. You are my best friend as well as my lover, and I do not know which side of you I enjoy the most. I treasure each side, just as I have treasured our life together. You are, and always have been, my dream. He\\'s more myself than I am. Whatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same. He can run faster than Severus Snape confronted with shampoo. Don\\'t think or judge, just listen. For attractive lips, speak words of kindness.For lovely eyes, seek out the good in people.For a slim figure, share your food with the hungry.For beautiful hair, let a child run his fingers through it once a day.For poise, walk with the knowledge youâ€™ll never walk alone....We leave you a tradition with a future.The tender loving care of human beings will never become obsolete.People even more than things have to be restored, renewed, revived, reclaimed and redeemed and redeemed and redeemed.Never throw out anybody.Remember, if you ever need a helping hand, youâ€™ll find one at the end of your arm.As you grow older, you will discover that you have two hands: one for helping yourself, the other for helping others.Your â€œgood old daysâ€� are still ahead of you, may you have many of them. In the depth of winter, I finally learned that within me there lay an invincible summer. You cannot find peace by avoiding life. In a good bookroom you feel in some mysterious way that you are absorbing the wisdom contained in all the books through your skin, without even opening them. Friendship is unnecessary, like philosophy, like art.... It has no survival value; rather it is one of those things which give value to survival. I would always rather be happy than dignified. And now Iâ€™m looking at you,â€� he said, â€œand youâ€™re asking me if I still want you, as if I could stop loving you. As if I would want to give up the thing that makes me stronger than anything else ever has. I never dared give much of myself to anyone before â€ bits of myself to the Lightwoods, to Isabelle and Alec, but it took years to do it â€ but, Clary, since the first time I saw you, I have belonged to you completely. I still do. If you want me. Grief does not change you, Hazel. It reveals you. Promise YourselfTo be so strong that nothingcan disturb your peace of mind.To talk health, happiness, and prosperityto every person you meet.To make all your friends feelthat there is something in themTo look at the sunny side of everythingand make your optimism come true.To think only the best, to work only for the best,and to expect only the best.To be just as enthusiastic about the success of othersas you are about your own.To forget the mistakes of the pastand press on to the greater achievements of the future.To wear a cheerful countenance at all timesand give every living creature you meet a smile.To give so much time to the improvement of yourselfthat you have no time to criticize others.To be too large for worry, too noble for anger, too strong for fear,and too happy to permit the presence of trouble.To think well of yourself and to proclaim this fact to the world,not in loud words but great deeds.To live in faith that the whole world is on your sideso long as you are true to the best that is in you. Facts do not cease to exist because they are ignored. Happy Hunger Games! And may the odds be ever in your favor. Those who believe in telekinetics, raise my hand. I hope she\\'ll be a fool -- that\\'s the best thing a girl can be in this world, a beautiful little fool. When you\\'re in jail, a good friend will be trying to bail you out. A best friend will be in the cell next to you saying, \\'Damn, that was fun\\'. Don\\'t touch any of my weapons without my permission.\"\"Well, there goes my plan for selling them all on eBay,\" Clary muttered.\"Selling them on what?\"Clary smiled blandly at him. \"A mythical place of great magical power. Some humans would do anything to see if it was possible to do it. If you put a large switch in some cave somewhere, with a sign on it saying \\'End-of-the-World Switch. PLEASE DO NOT TOUCH\\', the paint wouldn\\'t even have time to dry. Whatever you are, be a good one. If more of us valued food and cheer and song above hoarded gold, it would be a merrier world. I wanted a perfect ending. Now I\\'ve learned, the hard way, that some poems don\\'t rhyme, and some stories don\\'t have a clear beginning, middle, and end. Life is about not knowing, having to change, taking the moment and making the best of it, without knowing what\\'s going to happen next.Delicious Ambiguity. A good friend will always stab you in the front. Promise me you\\'ll always remember: You\\'re braver than you believe, and stronger than you seem, and smarter than you think. For instance, on the planet Earth, man had always assumed that he was more intelligent than dolphins because he had achieved so muchâ€the wheel, New York, wars and so onâ€whilst all the dolphins had ever done was muck about in the water having a good time. But conversely, the dolphins had always believed that they were far more intelligent than manâ€for precisely the same reasons. When you are courting a nice girl an hour seems like a second. When you sit on a red-hot cinder a second seems like an hour. That\\'s relativity. There\\'s a fine line between genius and insanity. I have erased this line. If ever there is tomorrow when we\\'re not together... there is something you must always remember. You are braver than you believe, stronger than you seem, and smarter than you think. But the most important thing is, even if we\\'re apart... I\\'ll always be with you. Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a harder battle. Sleep is good, he said, and books are better. Where there is love there is life. You can\\'t force love, I realized. It\\'s there or it isn\\'t. If it\\'s not there, you\\'ve got to be able to admit it. If it is there, you\\'ve got to do whatever it takes to protect the ones you love. May you live every day of your life. Two wrongs don\\'t make a right, but they make a good excuse. Wicked people never have time for reading. It\\'s one of the reasons for their wickedness. Women are meant to be loved, not to be understood. Above all, don\\'t lie to yourself. The man who lies to himself and listens to his own lie comes to a point that he cannot distinguish the truth within him, or around him, and so loses all respect for himself and for others. And having no respect he ceases to love. And those who were seen dancing were thought to be insane by those who could not hear the music. When it comes down to it, I let them think what they want. If they care enough to bother with what I do, then I\\'m already better than them. Who controls the past controls the future. Who controls the present controls the past. Death\\'s got an Invisibility Cloak?\" Harry interrupted again.\"So he can sneak up on people,\" said Ron. \"Sometimes he gets bored of running at them, flapping his arms and shrieking... You will always be fond of me. I represent to you all the sins you never had the courage to commit. Man is the only creature who refuses to be what he is. I think you still love me, but we canâ€™t escape the fact that Iâ€™m not enough for you. I knew this was going to happen. So Iâ€™m not blaming you for falling in love with another woman. Iâ€™m not angry, either. I should be, but Iâ€™m not. I just feel pain. A lot of pain. I thought I could imagine how much this would hurt, but I was wrong. Substitute \\'damn\\' every time you\\'re inclined to write \\'very;\\' your editor will delete it and the writing will be just as it should be. I\\'ve never fooled anyone. I\\'ve let people fool themselves. They didn\\'t bother to find out who and what I was. Instead they would invent a character for me. I wouldn\\'t argue with them. They were obviously loving somebody I wasn\\'t. First they ignore you. Then they ridicule you. And then they attack you and want to burn you. And then they build monuments to you. We write to taste life twice, in the moment and in retrospect. You know the world is going crazy when the best rapper is a white guy, the best golfer is a black guy, the tallest guy in the NBA is Chinese, the Swiss hold the America\\'s Cup, France is accusing the U.S. of arrogance, Germany doesn\\'t want to go to war, and the three most powerful men in America are named \"Bush\", \"Dick\", and \"Colin.\" Need I say more? It means \\'Shadowhunters: Looking Better in Black Than the Widows of our Enemies Since 1234\\'. I don\\'t want to go to heaven. None of my friends are there. I have hated words and I have loved them, and I hope I have made them right. Some women choose to follow men, and some women choose to follow their dreams. If you\\'re wondering which way to go, remember that your career will never wake up and tell you that it doesn\\'t love you anymore. Every heart sings a song, incomplete, until another heart whispers back. Those who wish to sing always find a song. At the touch of a lover, everyone becomes a poet. I love sleep. My life has the tendency to fall apart when I\\'m awake, you know? I, with a deeper instinct, choose a man who compels my strength, who makes enormous demands on me, who does not doubt my courage or my toughness, who does not believe me naÃ¯ve or innocent, who has the courage to treat me like a woman. A clever person solves a problem. A wise person avoids it. It\\'s really a wonder that I haven\\'t dropped all my ideals, because they seem so absurd and impossible to carry out. Yet I keep them, because in spite of everything, I still believe that people are really good at heart. Nobody has ever measured, not even poets, how much the heart can hold. Doubt thou the stars are fire;Doubt that the sun doth move;Doubt truth to be a liar;But never doubt I love. The best love is the kind that awakens the soul and makes us reach for more, that plants a fire in our hearts and brings peace to our minds. And that\\'s what you\\'ve given me. That\\'s what I\\'d hoped to give you forever Let us find the dam snack bar,\" Zoe said. \"We should eat while we can.\"Grover cracked a smile. \"The dam snack bar?\"Zoe blinked. \"Yes. What is funny?\"\"Nothing,\" Grover said, trying to keep a straight face. \"I could use some dam french fries.\"Even Thalia smiled at that. \"And I need to use the dam restroom.\"...I started cracking up, and Thalia and Grover joined in, while Zoe just looked at me. \"I do not understand.\"\"I want to use the dam water fountain,\" Grover said.\"And...\" Thalia tried to catch her breath. \"I want to buy a dam t-shirt. We all die. The goal isn\\'t to live forever, the goal is to create something that will. Once upon a time there was a boy who loved a girl, and her laughter was a question he wanted to spend his whole life answering. Well, don\\'t expect us to be too impressed. We just saw Finnick Odair in his underwear. There are two basic motivating forces: fear and love. When we are afraid, we pull back from life. When we are in love, we open to all that life has to offer with passion, excitement, and acceptance. We need to learn to love ourselves first, in all our glory and our imperfections. If we cannot love ourselves, we cannot fully open to our ability to love others or our potential to create. Evolution and all hopes for a better world rest in the fearlessness and open-hearted vision of people who embrace life. The meeting of two personalities is like the contact of two chemical substances: if there is any reaction, both are transformed. It\\'s only after we\\'ve lost everything that we\\'re free to do anything. Get busy living or get busy dying. I can believe things that are true and things that aren\\'t true and I can believe things where nobody knows if they\\'re true or not. I can believe in Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny and the Beatles and Marilyn Monroe and Elvis and Mister Ed. Listen - I believe that people are perfectable, that knowledge is infinite, that the world is run by secret banking cartels and is visited by aliens on a regular basis, nice ones that look like wrinkled lemurs and bad ones who mutilate cattle and want our water and our women. I believe that the future sucks and I believe that the future rocks and I believe that one day White Buffalo Woman is going to come back and kick everyone\\'s ass. I believe that all men are just overgrown boys with deep problems communicating and that the decline in good sex in America is coincident with the decline in drive-in movie theaters from state to state. I believe that all politicians are unprincipled crooks and I still believe that they are better than the alternative. I believe that California is going to sink into the sea when the big one comes, while Florida is going to dissolve into madness and alligators and toxic waste. I believe that antibacterial soap is destroying our resistance to dirt and disease so that one day we\\'ll all be wiped out by the common cold like martians in War of the Worlds. I believe that the greatest poets of the last century were Edith Sitwell and Don Marquis, that jade is dried dragon sperm, and that thousands of years ago in a former life I was a one-armed Siberian shaman. I believe that mankind\\'s destiny lies in the stars. I believe that candy really did taste better when I was a kid, that it\\'s aerodynamically impossible for a bumble bee to fly, that light is a wave and a particle, that there\\'s a cat in a box somewhere who\\'s alive and dead at the same time (although if they don\\'t ever open the box to feed it it\\'ll eventually just be two different kinds of dead), and that there are stars in the universe billions of years older than the universe itself. I believe in a personal god who cares about me and worries and oversees everything I do. I believe in an impersonal god who set the universe in motion and went off to hang with her girlfriends and doesn\\'t even know that I\\'m alive. I believe in an empty and godless universe of causal chaos, background noise, and sheer blind luck. I believe that anyone who says sex is overrated just hasn\\'t done it properly. I believe that anyone who claims to know what\\'s going on will lie about the little things too. I believe in absolute honesty and sensible social lies. I believe in a woman\\'s right to choose, a baby\\'s right to live, that while all human life is sacred there\\'s nothing wrong with the death penalty if you can trust the legal system implicitly, and that no one but a moron would ever trust the legal system. I believe that life is a game, that life is a cruel joke, and that life is what happens when you\\'re alive and that you might as well lie back and enjoy it. If my life is going to mean anything, I have to live it myself. Libraries were full of ideasâ€perhaps the most dangerous and powerful of all weapons. You educate a man; you educate a man. You educate a woman; you educate a generation. When someone shows you who they are believe them the first time. And once the storm is over, you wonâ€™t remember how you made it through, how you managed to survive. You wonâ€™t even be sure, whether the storm is really over. But one thing is certain. When you come out of the storm, you wonâ€™t be the same person who walked in. Thatâ€™s what this stormâ€™s all about. I believe that imagination is stronger than knowledge. That myth is more potent than history. That dreams are more powerful than facts. That hope always triumphs over experience. That laughter is the only cure for grief. And I believe that love is stronger than death. If the world were merely seductive, that would be easy. If it were merely challenging, that would be no problem. But I arise in the morning torn between a desire to improve the world and a desire to enjoy the world. This makes it hard to plan the day. Chance is perhaps the pseudonym of God when he does not want to sign. You\\'re a prefect? Oh Ronnie! That\\'s everyone in the family!\"\"What are Fred and I? Next door neighbors? These woods are lovely, dark and deep,But I have promises to keep,And miles to go before I sleep,And miles to go before I sleep. We fell in love, despite our differences, and once we did, something rare and beautiful was created. For me, love like that has only happened once, and that\\'s why every minute we spent together has been seared in my memory. I\\'ll never forget a single moment of it. We loved with a love that was more than love. Going to church doesnâ€™t make you a Christian any more than going to a garage makes you an automobile. Reader, suppose you were an idiot. And suppose you were a member of Congress. But I repeat myself. To love. To be loved. To never forget your own insignificance. To never get used to the unspeakable violence and the vulgar disparity of life around you. To seek joy in the saddest places. To pursue beauty to its lair. To never simplify what is complicated or complicate what is simple. To respect strength, never power. Above all, to watch. To try and understand. To never look away. And never, never to forget. All the world is made of faith, and trust, and pixie dust. Your task is not to seek for love, but merely to seek and find all the barriers within yourself that you have built against it. It is sometimes an appropriate response to reality to go insane. And now here is my secret, a very simple secret: It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye. Books are the perfect entertainment: no commercials, no batteries, hours of enjoyment for each dollar spent. What I wonder is why everybody doesn\\'t carry a book around for those inevitable dead spots in life. Attitude is a choice. Happiness is a choice. Optimism is a choice. Kindness is a choice. Giving is a choice. Respect is a choice. Whatever choice you make makes you. Choose wisely. You can\\'t stay in your corner of the Forest waiting for others to come to you. You have to go to them sometimes. The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves. Out beyond ideas of wrongdoing and rightdoing there is a field.I\\'ll meet you there.When the soul lies down in that grassthe world is too full to talk about. We have to dare to be ourselves, however frightening or strange that self may prove to be. This is a good sign, having a broken heart. It means we have tried for something. Eleanor was right. She never looked nice. She looked like art, and art wasn\\'t supposed to look nice; it was supposed to make you feel something. Isn\\'t it nice to think that tomorrow is a new day with no mistakes in it yet? I DON\\'T CARE!\" Harry yelled at them, snatching up a lunascope and throwing it into the fireplace. \"I\\'VE HAD ENOUGH, I\\'VE SEEN ENOUGH, I WANT OUT, I WANT IT TO END, I DON\\'T CARE ANYMORE!\"\"You do care,\" said Dumbledore. He had not flinched or made a single move to stop Harry demolishing his office. His expression was calm, almost detached. \"You care so much you feel as though you will bleed to death with the pain of it. Anyone who lives within their means suffers from a lack of imagination. I do not want people to be very agreeable, as it saves me the trouble of liking them a great deal. And I\\'m suppose to sit by while you date boys and fall in love with someone else, get married...?\" His voice tightened. \"And meanwhile, I\\'ll die a little bit more every day, watching. And so the lion fell in love with the lambâ€¦\" he murmured. I looked away, hiding my eyes as I thrilled to the word.\"What a stupid lamb,\" I sighed.\"What a sick, masochistic lion. Let us read, and let us dance; these two amusements will never do any harm to the world. Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot,Nothing is going to get better. It\\'s not. Life is a book and there are a thousand pages I have not yet read. There will come a time when all of us are dead. All of us. There will come a time when there are no human beings remaining to remember that anyone ever existed or that our species ever did anything. There will be no one left to remember Aristotle or Cleopatra, let alone you. Everything that we did and built and wrote and thought and discovered will be forgotten and all of this will have been for naught. Maybe that time is coming soon and maybe it is millions of years away, but even if we survive the collapse of our sun, we will not survive forever. There was time before organisms experienced consciousness, and there will be time after. And if the inevitability of human oblivion worries you, I encourage you to ignore it. God knows thatâ€™s what everyone else does. Deep in the meadow, hidden far awayA cloak of leaves, a moonbeam rayForget your woes and let your troubles layAnd when it\\'s morning again, they\\'ll wash awayHere it\\'s safe, here it\\'s warmHere the daisies guard you from every harmHere your dreams are sweet and tomorrow brings them trueHere is the place where I love you. Some books should be tasted, some devoured, but only a few should be chewed and digested thoroughly. Tell me, what is it you plan to do with your one wild and precious life? To the people who look at the stars and wish, Rhys.\"Rhys clinked his glass against mine. â€œTo the stars who listenâ€ and the dreams that are answered. For those who believe in God, most of the big questions are answered. But for those of us who can\\'t readily accept the God formula, the big answers don\\'t remain stone-written. We adjust to new conditions and discoveries. We are pliable. Love need not be a command nor faith a dictum. I am my own god. We are here to unlearn the teachings of the church, state, and our educational system. We are here to drink beer. We are here to kill war. We are here to laugh at the odds and live our lives so well that Death will tremble to take us. The planet is fine. The people are fucked. Never laugh at live dragons. It is the unknown we fear when we look upon death and darkness, nothing more. It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it. I wanted so badly to lie down next to her on the couch, to wrap my arms around her and sleep. Not fuck, like in those movies. Not even have sex. Just sleep together in the most innocent sense of the phrase. But I lacked the courage and she had a boyfriend and I was gawky and she was gorgeous and I was hopelessly boring and she was endlessly fascinating. So I walked back to my room and collapsed on the bottom bunk, thinking that if people were rain, I was drizzle and she was hurricane. When I have a little money, I buy books; and if I have any left, I buy food and clothes. Hereâ€™s to books, the cheapest vacation you can buy. Eating and reading are two pleasures that combine admirably. I heard what you said. Iâ€™m not the silly romantic you think. I donâ€™t want the heavens or the shooting stars. I donâ€™t want gemstones or gold. I have those things already. I wantâ€¦a steady hand. A kind soul. I want to fall asleep, and wake, knowing my heart is safe. I want to love, and be loved. If you expect nothing from somebody you are never disappointed. I believe in everything until it\\'s disproved. So I believe in fairies, the myths, dragons. It all exists, even if it\\'s in your mind. Who\\'s to say that dreams and nightmares aren\\'t as real as the here and now? Reading is one form of escape. Running for your life is another. How lucky I am to have known somebody and something that saying goodbye to is so damned awful. Every saint has a past, and every sinner has a future. The secret of life, though, is to fall seven times and to get up eight times. I might be in love with you.\" He smiles a little. \"I\\'m waiting until I\\'m sure to tell you, though. A guy and a girl can be just friends, but at one point or another, they will fall for each other...Maybe temporarily, maybe at the wrong time, maybe too late, or maybe forever The more I know of the world, the more I am convinced that I shall never see a man whom I can really love. I require so much! Hope is the thing with feathers That perches in the soul And sings the tune without the words And never stops at all. Any fool can know. The point is to understand. Reality is merely an illusion, albeit a very persistent one. Do you remember back at the hotel when you promised that if we lived, youâ€™d get dressed up in a nurseâ€™s outfit and give me a sponge bath?\" asked Jace.\"It was Simon who promised you the sponge bath.\"\"As soon as Iâ€™m back on my feet, handsome,\" said Simon.\"I knew we should have left you a rat. You can talk with someone for years, everyday, and still, it won\\'t mean as much as what you can have when you sit in front of someone, not saying a word, yet you feel that person with your heart, you feel like you have known the person for forever.... connections are made with the heart, not the tongue. Those who dream by day are cognizant of many things which escape those who dream only by night. I took a deep breath and listened to the old brag of my heart. I am, I am, I am. One, remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet. Two, never give up work. Work gives you meaning and purpose and life is empty without it. Three, if you are lucky enough to find love, remember it is there and don\\'t throw it away. Sometimes you climb out of bed in the morning and you think, I\\'m not going to make it, but you laugh inside â€ remembering all the times you\\'ve felt that way. The world is a book and those who do not travel read only one page. There are no good girls gone wrong - just bad girls found out. You get a little moody sometimes but I think that\\'s because you like to read. People that like to read are always a little fucked up. Never go to bed mad. Stay up and fight. Donâ€™t go around saying the world owes you a living. The world owes you nothing. It was here first. If we knew what it was we were doing, it would not be called research, would it? One day I will find the right words, and they will be simple. Life can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards. Faithless is he that says farewell when the road darkens. Pain is inevitable. Suffering is optional. If a cluttered desk is a sign of a cluttered mind, of what, then, is an empty desk a sign? I am not young enough to know everything. We live and breathe words. .... It was books that made me feel that perhaps I was not completely alone. They could be honest with me, and I with them. Reading your words, what you wrote, how you were lonely sometimes and afraid, but always brave; the way you saw the world, its colors and textures and sounds, I felt--I felt the way you thought, hoped, felt, dreamt. I felt I was dreaming and thinking and feeling with you. I dreamed what you dreamed, wanted what you wanted--and then I realized that truly I just wanted you. I have no special talents. I am only passionately curious. I like work: it fascinates me. I can sit and look at it for hours. Don\\'t be pushed around by the fears in your mind. Be led by the dreams in your heart. When I was 5 years old, my mother always told me that happiness was the key to life. When I went to school, they asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up. I wrote down â€˜happyâ€™. They told me I didnâ€™t understand the assignment, and I told them they didnâ€™t understand life. If you\\'re reading this...Congratulations, you\\'re alive.If that\\'s not something to smile about,then I don\\'t know what is. That\\'s always seemed so ridiculous to me, that people want to be around someone because they\\'re pretty. It\\'s like picking your breakfeast cereals based on color instead of taste. Sarcasm is the last refuge of the imaginatively bankrupt. Malachi scowled. \"I don\\'t remember the Clave inviting you into the Glass City, Magnus Bane.\"\"They didn\\'t,\" Magnus said. \"Your wards are down.\"\"Really?\" the Consul\\'s voice dripped sarcasm. \"I hadn\\'t noticed.\"Magnus looked concerned. \"That\\'s terrible. Someone should have told you.\" He glanced at Luke. \"Tell him the wards are down. I have decided to stick to love...Hate is too great a burden to bear. I wanted you to see what real courage is, instead of getting the idea that courage is a man with a gun in his hand. It\\'s when you know you\\'re licked before you begin, but you begin anyway and see it through no matter what.- Atticus Finch Always do what you are afraid to do. A life spent making mistakes is not only more honorable, but more useful than a life spent doing nothing. They say a person needs just three things to be truly happy in this world: someone to love, something to do, and something to hope for. I\\'ve never been lonely. I\\'ve been in a room -- I\\'ve felt suicidal. I\\'ve been depressed. I\\'ve felt awful -- awful beyond all -- but I never felt that one other person could enter that room and cure what was bothering me...or that any number of people could enter that room. In other words, loneliness is something I\\'ve never been bothered with because I\\'ve always had this terrible itch for solitude. It\\'s being at a party, or at a stadium full of people cheering for something, that I might feel loneliness. I\\'ll quote Ibsen, \"The strongest men are the most alone.\" I\\'ve never thought, \"Well, some beautiful blonde will come in here and give me a fuck-job, rub my balls, and I\\'ll feel good.\" No, that won\\'t help. You know the typical crowd, \"Wow, it\\'s Friday night, what are you going to do? Just sit there?\" Well, yeah. Because there\\'s nothing out there. It\\'s stupidity. Stupid people mingling with stupid people. Let them stupidify themselves. I\\'ve never been bothered with the need to rush out into the night. I hid in bars, because I didn\\'t want to hide in factories. That\\'s all. Sorry for all the millions, but I\\'ve never been lonely. I like myself. I\\'m the best form of entertainment I have. Let\\'s drink more wine! There is neither happiness nor misery in the world; there is only the comparison of one state with another, nothing more. He who has felt the deepest grief is best able to experience supreme happiness. We must have felt what it is to die, Morrel, that we may appreciate the enjoyments of life. \" Live, then, and be happy, beloved children of my heart, and never forget, that until the day God will deign to reveal the future to man, all human wisdom is contained in these two words, \\'Wait and Hope. Monsters are real, and ghosts are real too. They live inside us, and sometimes, they win. What\\'s meant to be will always find a way Make it a rule never to give a child a book you would not read yourself. In a time of deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act. Our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter. The mind is its own place, and in itself can make a heaven of hell, a hell of heaven.. We delight in the beauty of the butterfly, but rarely admit the changes it has gone through to achieve that beauty. I think that if I ever have kids, and they are upset, I won\\'t tell them that people are starving in China or anything like that because it wouldn\\'t change the fact that they were upset. And even if somebody else has it much worse, that doesn\\'t really change the fact that you have what you have. Talent hits a target no one else can hit. Genius hits a target no one else can see. When his life was ruined, his family killed, his farm destroyed, Job knelt down on the ground and yelled up to the heavens, \"Why god? Why me?\" and the thundering voice of God answered, There\\'s just something about you that pisses me off. There are two motives for reading a book; one, that you enjoy it; the other, that you can boast about it. It is a curious thing, the death of a loved one. We all know that our time in this world is limited, and that eventually all of us will end up underneath some sheet, never to wake up. And yet it is always a surprise when it happens to someone we know. It is like walking up the stairs to your bedroom in the dark, and thinking there is one more stair than there is. Your foot falls down, through the air, and there is a sickly moment of dark surprise as you try and readjust the way you thought of things. Of all sad words of tongue or pen, the saddest are these, \\'It might have been. I\\'m coming back into focus when Caesar asks him if he has a girlfriend back home. Peeta hesitates, then gives an unconvincing shake of his head.Handsome lad like you. There must be some special girl. Come on, whatâ€™s her name?\" says Caesar.Peeta sighs. \"Well, there is this one girl. Iâ€™ve had a crush on her ever since I can remember. But Iâ€™m pretty sure she didnâ€™t know I was alive until the reaping.\"Sounds of sympathy from the crowd. Unrequited love they can relate to.She have another fellow?\" asks Caesar.I donâ€™t know, but a lot of boys like her,\" says Peeta.So, hereâ€™s what you do. You win, you go home. She canâ€™t turn you down then, eh?\" says Caesar encouragingly.I donâ€™t think itâ€™s going to work out. Winning...wonâ€™t help in my case,\" says Peeta.Why ever not?\" says Caesar, mystified.Peeta blushes beet red and stammers out. \"Because...because...she came here with me. The boy never cried again, and he never forgot what he\\'d learned: that to love is to destroy, and that to be loved is to be the one destroyed. Experience is merely the name men gave to their mistakes. In the end, we will remember not the words of our enemies, but the silence of our friends. The flower that blooms in adversity is the rarest and most beautiful of all. Do not let your fire go out, spark by irreplaceable spark in the hopeless swamps of the not-quite, the not-yet, and the not-at-all. Do not let the hero in your soul perish in lonely frustration for the life you deserved and have never been able to reach. The world you desire can be won. It exists.. it is real.. it is possible.. it\\'s yours. THE FIRST TEN LIES THEY TELL YOU IN HIGH SCHOOL 1. We are here to help you. 2. You will have time to get to your class before the bell rings. 3. The dress code will be enforced. 4. No smoking is allowed on school grounds. 5.

There is a theory which states that if ever anyone discovers exactly what the Universe is for and why it is here, it will instantly disappear and be replaced by something even more bizarre and inexplicable. There is another theory which states that this has already happened. Give a girl the right shoes, and she can conquer the world. Augustus Waters was a self-aggrandizing bastard. But we forgive him. We forgive him not because he had a heart as figuratively good as his literal one sucked, or because he knew more about how to hold a cigarette than any nonsmoker in history, or because he got eighteen years when he should\\'ve gotten more.\\'\\'Seventeen,\\' Gus corrected.\\'I\\'m assuming you\\'ve got some time, you interupting bastard.\\'I\\'m telling you,\\' Isaac continued, \\'Augustus Waters talked so much that he\\'d interupt you at his own funeral. And he was pretentious: Sweet Jesus Christ, that kid never took a piss without pondering the abundant metaphorical resonances of human waste production. And he was vain: I do not believe I have ever met a more physically attractive person who was more acutely aware of his own physical attractiveness.\\'But I will say this: When the scientists of the future show up at my house with robot eyes and they tell me to try them on, I will tell the scientists to screw off, because I do not want to see a world without him.\\'I was kind of crying by then. A thing is not necessarily true because a man dies for it. Somewhere, something incredible is waiting to be known. It is so hard to leaveâ€until you leave. And then it is the easiest goddamned thing in the world. You have enemies? Good. That means you\\'ve stood up for something, sometime in your life. Hearts are made to be broken. Once you learn to read, you will be forever free. You think your pain and your heartbreak are unprecedented in the history of the world, but then you read. It was books that taught me that the things that tormented me most were the very things that connected me with all the people who were alive, who had ever been alive. Faith is taking the first step even when you can\\'t see the whole staircase. Think of all the beauty still left around you and be happy. Instead of worrying about what you cannot control, shift your energy to what you can create. Whether you think you can, or you think you can\\'t--you\\'re right. The loneliest moment in someoneâ€™s life is when they are watching their whole world fall apart, and all they can do is stare blankly. It is hard enough to remember my opinions, without also remembering my reasons for them! I saw my life branching out before me like the green fig tree in the story. From the tip of every branch, like a fat purple fig, a wonderful future beckoned and winked. One fig was a husband and a happy home and children, and another fig was a famous poet and another fig was a brilliant professor, and another fig was Ee Gee, the amazing editor, and another fig was Europe and Africa and South America, and another fig was Constantin and Socrates and Attila and a pack of other lovers with queer names and offbeat professions, and another fig was an Olympic lady crew champion, and beyond and above these figs were many more figs I couldn\\'t quite make out. I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree, starving to death, just because I couldn\\'t make up my mind which of the figs I would choose. I wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant losing all the rest, and, as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go black, and, one by one, they plopped to the ground at my feet. Why did you do all this for me?\\' he asked. \\'I don\\'t deserve it. I\\'ve never done anything for you.\\' \\'You have been my friend,\\' replied Charlotte. \\'That in itself is a tremendous thing. There is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so. Fantasy is hardly an escape from reality. It\\'s a way of understanding it. The world is indeed full of peril, and in it there are many dark places; but still there is much that is fair, and though in all lands love is now mingled with grief, it grows perhaps the greater. Two people in love, alone, isolated from the world, that\\'s beautiful. I want to stand as close to the edge as I can without going over. Out on the edge you see all kinds of things you can\\'t see from the center. Books so special and rare and yours that advertising your affection feels like a betrayal. I did not attend his funeral, but I sent a nice letter saying I approved of it. Here\\'s all you have to know about men and women: women are crazy, men are stupid. And the main reason women are crazy is that men are stupid. You don\\'t love someone for their looks, or their clothes, or for their fancy car, but because they sing a song only you can hear. Where is human nature so weak as in the bookstore? Well, Iâ€™m not kissing the mundane,\" said Jace. \"Iâ€™d rather stay down here and rot.\"\"Forever?\" said Simon. \"Foreverâ€™s an awfully long time.\"Jace raised his eyebrows. \"I knew it,\" he said. \"You want to kiss me, donâ€™t you? The best index to a person\\'s character is how he treats people who can\\'t do him any good, and how he treats people who can\\'t fight back. All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way. Think before you speak. Read before you think. I cannot live without books. And by the way, everything in life is writable about if you have the outgoing guts to do it, and the imagination to improvise. The worst enemy to creativity is self-doubt. It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife. I have a history of making decisions very quickly about men. I have always fallen in love fast and without measuring risks. I have a tendency not only to see the best in everyone, but to assume that everyone is emotionally capable of reaching his highest potential. I have fallen in love more times than I care to count with the highest potential of a man, rather than with the man himself, and I have hung on to the relationship for a long time (sometimes far too long) waiting for the man to ascend to his own greatness. Many times in romance I have been a victim of my own optimism. If at first you don\\'t succeed, try, try again. Then quit. No use being a damn fool about it. This above all: to thine own self be true, And it must follow, as the night the day, Thou canst not then be false to any man. I have loved the stars too fondly to be fearful of the night. God created war so that Americans would learn geography. Hell is empty and all the devils are here. It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat. Waiting is painful. Forgetting is painful. But not knowing which to do is the worst kind of suffering. The wound is the place where the Light enters you. Courage is the most important of all the virtues because without courage, you can\\'t practice any other virtue consistently. Not everything is about you,\" Clary said furiously.\"Possibly,\" Jace said, \"but you do have to admit that the majority of things are. I can\\'t imagine a man really enjoying a book and reading it only once. No relationship is perfect, ever. There are always some ways you have to bend, to compromise, to give something up in order to gain something greater...The love we have for each other is bigger than these small differences. And that\\'s the key. It\\'s like a big pie chart, and the love in a relationship has to be the biggest piece. Love can make up for a lot. There are few people whom I really love, and still fewer of whom I think well. The more I see of the world, the more am I dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of merit or sense. What is a friend? A single soul dwelling in two bodies. I am a man\" he told her, \"and men do not consume pink beverages. Get thee gone woman, and bring me something brown. The most important thing is to enjoy your lifeâ€to be happyâ€it\\'s all that matters. For the two of us, home isn\\'t a place. It is a person. And we are finally home. If you\\'re going to try, go all the way. Otherwise, don\\'t even start. This could mean losing girlfriends, wives, relatives and maybe even your mind. It could mean not eating for three or four days. It could mean freezing on a park bench. It could mean jail. It could mean derision. It could mean mockery--isolation. Isolation is the gift. All the others are a test of your endurance, of how much you really want to do it. And, you\\'ll do it, despite rejection and the worst odds. And it will be better than anything else you can imagine. If you\\'re going to try, go all the way. There is no other feeling like that. You will be alone with the gods, and the nights will flame with fire. You will ride life straight to perfect laughter. It\\'s the only good fight there is. Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail. For you, a thousand times over Accept who you are. Unless you\\'re a serial killer. Love is always patient and kind. It is never jealous. Love is never boastful or conceited. It is never rude or selfish. It does not take offense and is not resentful. Love takes no pleasure in other peopleâ€™s sins, but delights in the truth. It is always ready to excuse, to trust, to hope, and to endure whatever comes. The most courageous act is still to think for yourself. Aloud. Never let your sense of morals prevent you from doing what is right. What the hell is that?\" I laughed.\"It\\'s my fox hat.\"\"Your fox hat?\"\"Yeah, Pudge. My fox hat.\"\"Why are you wearing your fox hat?\" I asked.\"Because no one can catch the motherfucking fox. People aren\\'t either wicked or noble. They\\'re like chef\\'s salads, with good things and bad things chopped and mixed together in a vinaigrette of confusion and conflict. A human being is a part of the whole called by us universe, a part limited in time and space. He experiences himself, his thoughts and feeling as something separated from the rest, a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us. Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty. Is this the part where you say if I hurt her, you\\'ll kill me?\"\"No\" Simon said, \"If you hurt Clary she\\'s quite capable of killing you herself. Possibly with a variety of weapons. I can be changed by what happens to me. But I refuse to be reduced by it.(Popular misquote of \"You may not control all the events that happen to you, but you can decide not to be reduced by them.\") Whoever fights monsters should see to it that in the process he does not become a monster. And if you gaze long enough into an abyss, the abyss will gaze back into you. I generally avoid temptation unless I can\\'t resist it. Have you ever been in love? Horrible isn\\'t it? It makes you so vulnerable. It opens your chest and it opens up your heart and it means that someone can get inside you and mess you up. You build up all these defenses, you build up a whole suit of armor, so that nothing can hurt you, then one stupid person, no different from any other stupid person, wanders into your stupid life...You give them a piece of you. They didn\\'t ask for it. They did something dumb one day, like kiss you or smile at you, and then your life isn\\'t your own anymore. Love takes hostages. It gets inside you. It eats you out and leaves you crying in the darkness, so simple a phrase like \\'maybe we should be just friends\\' turns into a glass splinter working its way into your heart. It hurts. Not just in the imagination. Not just in the mind. It\\'s a soul-hurt, a real gets-inside-you-and-rips-you-apart pain. I hate love. Read, read, read. Read everything -- trash, classics, good and bad, and see how they do it. Just like a carpenter who works as an apprentice and studies the master. Read! You\\'ll absorb it.Then write. If it\\'s good, you\\'ll find out. If it\\'s not, throw it out of the window. They didnâ€™t agree on much. In fact, they didnâ€™t agree on anything. They fought all the time and challenged each other ever day. But despite their differences, they had one important thing in common. They were crazy about each other. Love is so short, forgetting is so long. Books are mirrors: you only see in them what you already have inside you. If all else perished, and he remained, I should still continue to be; and if all else remained, and he were annihilated, the universe would turn to a mighty stranger. Not my daughter, you bitch! Bran thought about it. \\'Can a man still be brave if he\\'s afraid?\\'\\'That is the only time a man can be brave,\\' his father told him. Take responsibility of your own happiness, never put it in other peopleâ€™s hands. You never have to change anything you got up in the middle of the night to write. I think if I\\'ve learned anything about friendship, it\\'s to hang in, stay connected, fight for them, and let them fight for you. Don\\'t walk away, don\\'t be distracted, don\\'t be too busy or tired, don\\'t take them for granted. Friends are part of the glue that holds life and faith together. Powerful stuff. All little girls should be told they are pretty, even if they aren\\'t. Good books don\\'t give up all their secrets at once. If you can\\'t fly then run, if you can\\'t run then walk, if you can\\'t walk then crawl, but whatever you do you have to keep moving forward. It\\'s not true that I had nothing on. I had the radio on. The very essence of romance is uncertainty. You could have had anything else in the world, and you asked for me.\"She smiled up at him. Filthy as he was, covered in blood and dirt, he was the most beautiful thing she\\'d ever seen.\"But I don\\'t want anything else in the world. The unexamined life is not worth living. So please, oh please, we beg, we pray,Go throw your TV set away,And in its place you can installA lovely bookshelf on the wall.Then fill the shelves with lots of books. My experience of life is that it is not divided up into genres; itâ€™s a horrifying, romantic, tragic, comical, science-fiction cowboy detective novel. You know, with a bit of pornography if you\\'re lucky. It is not in the stars to hold our destiny but in ourselves. Everything in the world is about sex except sex. Sex is about power. I spent my life folded between the pages of books.In the absence of human relationships I formed bonds with paper characters. I lived love and loss through stories threaded in history; I experienced adolescence by association. My world is one interwoven web of words, stringing limb to limb, bone to sinew, thoughts and images all together. I am a being comprised of letters, a character created by sentences, a figment of imagination formed through fiction. Either write something worth reading or do something worth writing. If you remember me, then I don\\'t care if everyone else forgets. You said you were going for a walk!? What kind of walk takes six hours?\"\"A long one? Try not to become a man of success. Rather become a man of value. Be the reason someone smiles. Be the reason someone feels loved and believes in the goodness in people. There is always some madness in love. But there is also always some reason in madness. Happiness is a warm puppy. I didn\\'t want to wake up. I was having a much better time asleep. And that\\'s really sad. It was almost like a reverse nightmare, like when you wake up from a nightmare you\\'re so relieved. I woke up into a nightmare. Man is least himself when he talks in his own person. Give him a mask, and he will tell you the truth. Books may well be the only true magic. Reader\\'s Bill of Rights1. The right to not read 2. The right to skip pages 3. The right to not finish 4.

I was gratified to be able to answer promptly, and I did. I said I didnâ€™t know. Never allow someone to be your priority while allowing yourself to be their option. Turn your wounds into wisdom. No tears in the writer, no tears in the reader. No surprise in the writer, no surprise in the reader. Nobody realizes that some people expend tremendous energy merely to be normal. Those who find ugly meanings in beautiful things are corrupt without being charming. This is a fault. Those who find beautiful meanings in beautiful things are the cultivated. For these there is hope. They are the elect to whom beautiful things mean only Beauty. There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book. Books are well written, or badly written. That is all. Without pain, how could we know joy?\\' This is an old argument in the field of thinking about suffering and its stupidity and lack of sophistication could be plumbed for centuries but suffice it to say that the existence of broccoli does not, in any way, affect the taste of chocolate. Don\\'t ever tell anybody anything. If you do, you start missing everybody.

Respect other people\\'s feelings. It might mean nothing to you, but it could mean everything to them. Remember when you tried to convince me to feed a poultry pie to the mallards in the park to see if you could breed a race of cannibal ducks?\" \"They ate it too,\" Will reminisced. \"Bloodthirsty little beasts. Never trust a duck. We are all different. Donâ€™t judge, understand instead. Two possibilities exist: either we are alone in the Universe or we are not. Both are equally terrifying. When you have eliminated all which is impossible, then whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth. Men occasionally stumble over the truth, but most of them pick themselves up and hurry off as if nothing had happened. You gain strength, courage and confidence by every experience in which you really stop to look fear in the face. You are able to say to yourself, \\'I have lived through this horror. I can take the next thing that comes along.\\' You must do the thing you think you cannot do. The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existence. One cannot help but be in awe when he contemplates the mysteries of eternity, of life, of the marvelous structure of reality. It is enough if one tries merely to comprehend a little of this mystery each day.â€\"Old Man\\'s Advice to Youth: \\'Never Lose a Holy Curiosity.\\'\" LIFE Magazine (2 May 1955) p. 64 Many people, myself among them, feel better at the mere sight of a book. Deserves it! I daresay he does. Many that live deserve death. And some that die deserve life. Can you give it to them? Then do not be too eager to deal out death in judgement. For even the very wise cannot see all ends. I don\\'t know the question, but sex is definitely the answer. You cannot protect yourself from sadness without protecting yourself from happiness. Be mindful. Be grateful. Be positive. Be true. Be kind. Fantasy is a necessary ingredient in living, it\\'s a way of looking at life through the wrong end of a telescope. Above all, be the heroine of your life, not the victim. There comes a time when the world gets quiet and the only thing left is your own heart. So you\\'d better learn the sound of it. Otherwise you\\'ll never understand what it\\'s saying. All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others. Why fit in when you were born to stand out? Kiss me, and you will see how important I am. War is peace. Freedom is slavery. Ignorance is strength. Religion has actually convinced people that there\\'s an invisible man living in the sky who watches everything you do, every minute of every day. And the invisible man has a special list of ten things he does not want you to do. And if you do any of these ten things, he has a special place, full of fire and smoke and burning and torture and anguish, where he will send you to live and suffer and burn and choke and scream and cry forever and ever \\'til the end of time! But He loves you. He loves you, and He needs money! He always needs money! He\\'s all-powerful, all-perfect, all-knowing, and all-wise, somehow just can\\'t handle money! You\\'re still trying to protect me. Real or not real,\" he whispers.\"Real,\" I answer. \"Because that\\'s what you and I do, protect each other. There are worse crimes than burning books. One of them is not reading them. That\\'s the thing about books. They let you travel without moving your feet. Accept yourself, love yourself, and keep moving forward. If you want to fly, you have to give up what weighs you down. Whatever it is you\\'re seeking won\\'t come in the form you\\'re expecting. What matters in life is not what happens to you but what you remember and how you remember it. It is said that your life flashes before your eyes just before you die. That is true, it\\'s called Life. To douchebags!\" he said, gesturing to Brad. \"And to girls that break your heart,\" he bowed his head to me. His eyes lost focus. \"And to the absolute fucking horror of losing your best friend because you were stupid enough to fall in love with her. I am very interested and fascinated how everyone loves each other, but no one really likes each other. Everyone should be able to do one card trick, tell two jokes, and recite three poems, in case they are ever trapped in an elevator. Remember: the time you feel lonely is the time you most need to be by yourself. Life\\'s cruelest irony. You must stay drunk on writing so reality cannot destroy you. It may be unfair, but what happens in a few days, sometimes even a single day, can change the course of a whole lifetime... The simple things are also the most extraordinary things, and only the wise can see them. Painting is poetry that is seen rather than felt, and poetry is painting that is felt rather than seen. If you\\'re looking for sympathy you\\'ll find it between shit and syphilis in the dictionary. Life is too short to waste your time on people who donâ€™t respect, appreciate, and value you. I have great faith in fools - self-confidence my friends will call it. People are afraid of themselves, of their own reality; their feelings most of all. People talk about how great love is, but thatâ€™s bullshit. Love hurts. Feelings are disturbing. People are taught that pain is evil and dangerous. How can they deal with love if theyâ€™re afraid to feel? Pain is meant to wake us up. People try to hide their pain. But theyâ€™re wrong. Pain is something to carry, like a radio. You feel your strength in the experience of pain. Itâ€™s all in how you carry it. Thatâ€™s what matters. Pain is a feeling. Your feelings are a part of you. Your own reality. If you feel ashamed of them, and hide them, youâ€™re letting society destroy your reality. You should stand up for your right to feel your pain. I have found the paradox, that if you love until it hurts, there can be no more hurt, only more love. That does it,\" said Jace. \"I\\'m going to get you a dictionary for Christmas this year.\"\"Why?\" Isabelle said.\"So you can look up \\'fun.\\' I\\'m not sure you know what it means. You must have chaos within you to give birth to a dancing star. I don\\'t go looking for trouble. Trouble usually finds me. To be nobody but yourself in a world which is doing its best day and night to make you like everybody else means to fight the hardest battle which any human being can fight and never stop fighting. That is part of the beauty of all literature. You discover that your longings are universal longings, that you\\'re not lonely and isolated from anyone. You belong. They love their hair because they\\'re not smart enough to love something more interesting. Beneath the makeup and behind the smile I am just a girl who wishes for the world. Some tourists think Amsterdam is a city of sin, but in truth it is a city of freedom. And in freedom, most people find sin. You have your way. I have my way. As for the right way, the correct way, and the only way, it does not exist. As usual, there is a great woman behind every idiot. What happens when people open their hearts?\"\"They get better. Imagine yourself as a living house. God comes in to rebuild that house. At first, perhaps, you can understand what He is doing. He is getting the drains right and stopping the leaks in the roof and so on; you knew that those jobs needed doing and so you are not surprised. But presently He starts knocking the house about in a way that hurts abominably and does not seem to make any sense. What on earth is He up to? The explanation is that He is building quite a different house from the one you thought of - throwing out a new wing here, putting on an extra floor there, running up towers, making courtyards. You thought you were being made into a decent little cottage: but He is building a palace. He intends to come and live in it Himself. I have never listened to anyone who criticized my taste in space travel, sideshows or gorillas. When this occurs, I pack up my dinosaurs and leave the room. Prayer is not asking. It is a longing of the soul. It is daily admission of one\\'s weakness. It is better in prayer to have a heart without words than words without a heart. Books are my friends, my companions. They make me laugh and cry and find meaning in life. Man may have discovered fire, but women discovered how to play with it. I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look or the words, which laid the foundation. It is too long ago. I was in the middle before I knew that I had begun. Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world. Being crazy isn\\'t enough. One day, in retrospect, the years of struggle will strike you as the most beautiful. If you have a garden and a library, you have everything you need. Life is pain, highness. Anyone who says differently is selling something. If you are going through hell, keep going. Should I kill myself, or have a cup of coffee? Love doesn\\'t just sit there, like a stone, it has to be made, like bread; remade all the time, made new. I would have come for you. And if I couldn\\'t walk, I\\'d crawl to you, and no matter how broken we were, we\\'d fight our way out together-knives drawn, pistols blazing. Because that\\'s what we do. We never stop fighting. I lie to myself all the time. But I never believe me. But who prays for Satan? Who, in eighteen centuries, has had the common humanity to pray for the one sinner that needed it most? Time flies like an arrow; fruit flies like a banana. Percy wouldn\\'t notice a joke if it danced naked in front of him wearing one of Dobby\\'s hats. Never be afraid to raise your voice for honesty and truth and compassion against injustice and lying and greed. If people all over the world...would do this, it would change the earth. Books are like mirrors: if a fool looks in, you cannot expect a genius to look out. But I donâ€™t want to go among mad people,\" Alice remarked.\"Oh, you canâ€™t help that,\" said the Cat: \"weâ€™re all mad here. Iâ€™m mad. Youâ€™re mad.\"\"How do you know Iâ€™m mad?\" said Alice.\"You must be,\" said the Cat, \"or you wouldnâ€™t have come here. Nothing of me is original. I am the combined effort of everyone I\\'ve ever known. The difference between the almost right word and the right word is really a large matter. â€™tis the difference between the lightning bug and the lightning. I like your Christ, I do not like your Christians. Your Christians are so unlike your Christ. I think God, in creating man, somewhat overestimated his ability. What I want is to be needed. What I need is to be indispensable to somebody. Who I need is somebody that will eat up all my free time, my ego, my attention. Somebody addicted to me. A mutual addiction. Reading was my escape and my comfort, my consolation, my stimulant of choice: reading for the pure pleasure of it, for the beautiful stillness that surrounds you when you hear an author\\'s words reverberating in your head. Stories of imagination tend to upset those without one. It isn\\'t what you have or who you are or where you are or what you are doing that makes you happy or unhappy. It is what you think about it. A girl should be two things: classy and fabulous. What I need is the dandelion in the spring. The bright yellow that means rebirth instead of destruction. The promise that life can go on, no matter how bad our losses. That it can be good again. I love people who make me laugh. I honestly think it\\'s the thing I like most, to laugh. It cures a multitude of ills. It\\'s probably the most important thing in a person. When a man gives his opinion, he\\'s a man. When a woman gives her opinion, she\\'s a bitch. My daddy said, that the first time you fall in love, it changes you forever and no matter how hard you try, that feeling just never goes away. I don\\'t trust people who don\\'t love themselves and tell me, \\'I love you.\\' ... There is an African saying which is: Be careful when a naked person offers you a shirt. Every child is an artist. The problem is how to remain an artist once he grows up. Deadlines just aren\\'t real to me until I\\'m staring one in the face. Love does not consist of gazing at each other, but in looking outward together in the same direction. It hurts to let go. Sometimes it seems the harder you try to hold on to something or someone the more it wants to get away. You feel like some kind of criminal for having felt, for having wanted. For having wanted to be wanted. It confuses you, because you think that your feelings were wrong and it makes you feel so small because it\\'s so hard to keep it inside when you let it out and it doesn\\'t coma back. You\\'re left so alone that you can\\'t explain. Damn, there\\'s nothing like that, is there? I\\'ve been there and you have too. You\\'re nodding your head. I never travel without my diary. One should always have something sensational to read in the train. The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams. You cannot swim for new horizons until you have courage to lose sight of the shore. And, in the endThe love you takeis equal to the love you make. Live the Life of Your Dreams: Be brave enough to live the life of your dreams according to your vision and purpose instead of the expectations and opinions of others. There are three things all wise men fear: the sea in storm, a night with no moon, and the anger of a gentle man. No book is really worth reading at the age of ten which is not equally â€ and often far more â€ worth reading at the age of fifty and beyond. If heâ€™s not calling you, itâ€™s because you are not on his mind. If he creates expectations for you, and then doesnâ€™t follow through on little things, he will do same for big things. Be aware of this and realize that heâ€™s okay with disappointing you. Donâ€™t be with someone who doesnâ€™t do what they say theyâ€™re going to do. If heâ€™s choosing not to make a simple effort that would put you at ease and bring harmony to a recurring fight, then he doesnâ€™t respect your feelings and needs. â€œBusyâ€� is another word for â€œasshole.â€� â€œAssholeâ€� is another word for the guy youâ€™re dating. You deserve a fcking phone call. Why do you go away? So that you can come back. So that you can see the place you came from with new eyes and extra colors. And the people there see you differently, too. Coming back to where you started is not the same as never leaving. It was love at first sight, at last sight, at ever and ever sight. Resist much, obey little. Loyalty to country ALWAYS. Loyalty to government, when it deserves it. I like living. I have sometimes been wildly, despairingly, acutely miserable, racked with sorrow; but through it all I still know quite certainly that just to be alive is a grand thing. If you love somebody, let them go, for if they return, they were always yours. If they don\\'t, they never were. My tastes are simple: I am easily satisfied with the best. I don\\'t want to die without any scars. Believe in yourself. You are braver than you think, more talented than you know, and capable of more than you imagine. Truth is stranger than fiction, but it is because Fiction is obliged to stick to possibilities; Truth isn\\'t. If music be the food of love, play on,Give me excess of it; that surfeiting,The appetite may sicken, and so die. Show me a hero, and I\\'ll write you a tragedy. It\\'s a dangerous business, Frodo, going out your door. You step onto the road, and if you don\\'t keep your feet, there\\'s no knowing where you might be swept off to. I do not fear death. I had been dead for billions and billions of years before I was born, and had not suffered the slightest inconvenience from it. Angry people are not always wise. By three methods we may learn wisdom: First, by reflection, which is noblest; Second, by imitation, which is easiest; and third by experience, which is the bitterest. What is an \"instant\" death anyway? How long is an instant? Is it one second? Ten? The pain of those seconds must have been awful as her heart burst and her lungs collapsed and there was no air and no blood to her brain and only raw panic. What the hell is instant? Nothing is instant. Instant rice takes five minutes, instant pudding an hour. I doubt that an instant of blinding pain feels particularly instantaneous. I am not sure exactly what heaven will be like, but I know that when we die and it comes time for God to judge us, he will not ask, \\'How many good things have you done in your life?\\' rather he will ask, \\'How much love did you put into what you did? To be a Christian means to forgive the inexcusable because God has forgiven the inexcusable in you. In the case of good books, the point is not to see how many of them you can get through, but rather how many can get through to you. She is too fond of books, and it has turned her brain. You haven\\'t got a letter on yours,\" George observed. \"I suppose she thinks you don\\'t forget your name. But we\\'re not stupid-we know we\\'re called Gred and Forge. Will looked horrified. \"What kind of monster could possibly hate chocolate? No medicine cures what happiness cannot. It\\'s a metaphor, see: You put the killing thing right between your teeth, but you don\\'t give it the power to do its killing. I am a badass, and I recognize that you, too, are a badass. because nerds like us are allowed to be unironically enthusiastic about stuff. Nerds are allowed to love stuff, like jump-up-and-down-in-the-chair-canâ€™t-control-yourself love it. Hank, when people call people nerds, mostly what theyâ€™re saying is â€˜you like stuff.â€™ Which is just not a good insult at all. Like, â€˜you are too enthusiastic about the miracle of human consciousnessâ€™. Donâ€™t waste your time in anger, regrets, worries, and grudges. Life is too short to be unhappy. Fiction is the truth inside the lie. The town was paper, but the memories were not. The fact that we live at the bottom of a deep gravity well, on the surface of a gas covered planet going around a nuclear fireball 90 million miles away and think this to be normal is obviously some indication of how skewed our perspective tends to be. My nightmares are usually about losing you. I\\'m okay once I realize you\\'re here. And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love. Don\\'t tell me the moon is shining; show me the glint of light on broken glass. Weâ€™re all seeking that special person who is right for us. But if youâ€™ve been through enough relationships, you begin to suspect thereâ€™s no right person, just different flavors of wrong. Why is this? Because you yourself are wrong in some way, and you seek out partners who are wrong in some complementary way. But it takes a lot of living to grow fully into your own wrongness. And it isnâ€™t until you finally run up against your deepest demons, your unsolvable problemsâ€the ones that make you truly who you areâ€that weâ€™re ready to find a lifelong mate. Only then do you finally know what youâ€™re looking for. Youâ€™re looking for the wrong person. But not just any wrong person: it\\'s got to be the right wrong personâ€someone you lovingly gaze upon and think, â€œThis is the problem I want to have.â€�I will find that special person who is wrong for me in just the right way. The road to hell is paved with adverbs. Itâ€™s only after youâ€™ve stepped outside your comfort zone that you begin to change, grow, and transform. Wow,\" Thalia muttered. \"Apollo is hot.\" \"He\\'s the sun god,\" I said.\"That\\'s not what I meant. When he shall die,Take him and cut him out in little stars,And he will make the face of heaven so fineThat all the world will be in love with nightAnd pay no worship to the garish sun. Love is a fire. But whether it is going to warm your hearth or burn down your house, you can never tell. Fear doesn\\'t shut you down; it wakes you up Why do people have to be this lonely? What\\'s the point of it all? Millions of people in this world, all of them yearning, looking to others to satisfy them, yet isolating themselves. Why? Was the earth put here just to nourish human loneliness? The most important things are the hardest to say. They are the things you get ashamed of, because words diminish them -- words shrink things that seemed limitless when they were in your head to no more than living size when they\\'re brought out. But it\\'s more than that, isn\\'t it? The most important things lie too close to wherever your secret heart is buried, like landmarks to a treasure your enemies would love to steal away. And you may make revelations that cost you dearly only to have people look at you in a funny way, not understanding what you\\'ve said at all, or why you thought it was so important that you almost cried while you were saying it. That\\'s the worst, I think. When the secret stays locked within not for want of a teller but for want of an understanding ear. Love conquers all,\" Aphrodite promised. \"Look at Helen and Paris. Did they let anything come between them?\"\"Didn\\'t they start the Trojan War and get thousands of people killed?\"\"Pfft. That\\'s not the point. Follow your heart. You do not write your life with words...You write it with actions. What you think is not important. It is only important what you do. Maybe \\'okay\\' will be our \\'always Freedom is not worth having if it does not include the freedom to make mistakes. Don\\'t let the expectations and opinions of other people affect your decisions. It\\'s your life, not theirs. Do what matters most to you; do what makes you feel alive and happy. Don\\'t let the expectations and ideas of others limit who you are. If you let others tell you who you are, you are living their reality â€ not yours. There is more to life than pleasing people. There is much more to life than following others\\' prescribed path. There is so much more to life than what you experience right now. You need to decide who you are for yourself. Become a whole being. Adventure. Life\\'s under no obligation to give us what we expect. It\\'s strange because sometimes, I read a book, and I think I am the people in the book. My dear,Find what you love and let it kill you.Let it drain you of your all. Let it cling onto your back and weigh you down into eventual nothingness.Let it kill you and let it devour your remains.For all things will kill you, both slowly and fastly, but itâ€™s much better to be killed by a lover.~ Falsely yours Happiness is having a large, loving, caring, close-knit family in another city. Don\\'t order any of the faerie food,\" said Jace, looking at her over the top of his menu. \"It tends to make humans a little crazy. One minute you\\'re munching a faerie plum, the next minute you\\'re running naked down Madison Avenue with antlers on your head. Not,\" he added hastily, \"that this has ever happened to me. More smiling, less worrying. More compassion, less judgment. More blessed, less stressed. More love, less hate. Nobody can hurt me without my permission. Don\\'t judge each day by the harvest you reap but by the seeds that you plant. Fire is catching! And if we burn, you burn with us! But I know, somehow, that only when it is dark enough can you see the stars. You are the answer to every prayer I\\'ve offered. You are a song, a dream, a whisper, and I don\\'t know how I could have lived without you for as long as I have. I was never really insane except upon occasions when my heart was touched. Sometimes crying or laughing are the only options left, and laughing feels better right now. What you seek is seeking you. It\\'s not denial. I\\'m just selective about the reality I accept. The best and most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or even touched. They must be felt with the heart You probably wouldnâ€™t worry about what people think of you if you could know how seldom they do. I have something I need to tell you,\" he says. I run my fingers along the tendons in his hands and look back at him. \"I might be in love with you.\" He smiles a little. \"I\\'m waiting until I\\'m sure to tell you, though.\"\"That\\'s sensible of you,\" I say, smiling too. \"We should find some paper so you can make a list or a chart or something.\"I feel his laughter against my side, his nose sliding along my jaw, his lips pressing my ear.\"Maybe I\\'m already sure,\" he says, \"and I just don\\'t want to frighten you.\"I laugh a little. \"Then you should know better.\"\"Fine,\" he says. \"Then I love you. Wrinkles should merely indicate where the smiles have been. Simplicity, patience, compassion.These three are your greatest treasures.Simple in actions and thoughts, you return to the source of being.Patient with both friends and enemies,you accord with the way things are.Compassionate toward yourself,you reconcile all beings in the world. The so-called â€˜psychotically depressedâ€™ person who tries to kill herself doesnâ€™t do so out of quote â€˜hopelessnessâ€™ or any abstract conviction that lifeâ€™s assets and debits do not square. And surely not because death seems suddenly appealing. The person in whom Its invisible agony reaches a certain unendurable level will kill herself the same way a trapped person will eventually jump from the window of a burning high-rise. Make no mistake about people who leap from burning windows. Their terror of falling from a great height is still just as great as it would be for you or me standing speculatively at the same window just checking out the view; i.e. the fear of falling remains a constant. The variable here is the other terror, the fireâ€™s flames: when the flames get close enough, falling to death becomes the slightly less terrible of two terrors. Itâ€™s not desiring the fall; itâ€™s terror of the flames. And yet nobody down on the sidewalk, looking up and yelling â€˜Donâ€™t!â€™ and â€˜Hang on!â€™, can understand the jump. Not really. Youâ€™d have to have personally been trapped and felt flames to really understand a terror way beyond falling. If pain must come, may it come quickly. Because I have a life to live, and I need to live it in the best way possible. If he has to make a choice, may he make it now. Then I will either wait for him or forget him. Yesterday I was clever, so I wanted to change the world. Today I am wise, so I am changing myself. Words are, of course, the most powerful drug used by mankind. The truth does not change according to our ability to stomach it. The worst part of holding the memories is not the pain. It\\'s the loneliness of it. Memories need to be shared. The past is a place of reference, not a place of residence; the past is a place of learning, not a place of living. What I say is, a town isnâ€™t a town without a bookstore. It may call itself a town, but unless itâ€™s got a bookstore, it knows itâ€™s not foolinâ€™ a soul. Don\\'t JustDon\\'t just learn, experience.Don\\'t just read, absorb.Don\\'t just change, transform.Don\\'t just relate, advocate.Don\\'t just promise, prove.Don\\'t just criticize, encourage.Don\\'t just think, ponder.Don\\'t just take, give.Don\\'t just see, feel.Donâ€™t just dream, do. Don\\'t just hear, listen.Don\\'t just talk, act.Don\\'t just tell, show.Don\\'t just exist, live. Let there be spaces in your togetherness, And let the winds of the heavens dance between you. Love one another but make not a bond of love: Let it rather be a moving sea between the shores of your souls. Fill each other\\'s cup but drink not from one cup. Give one another of your bread but eat not from the same loaf. Sing and dance together and be joyous, but let each one of you be alone, Even as the strings of a lute are alone though they quiver with the same music. Give your hearts, but not into each other\\'s keeping. For only the hand of Life can contain your hearts. And stand together, yet not too near together: For the pillars of the temple stand apart, And the oak tree and the cypress grow not in each other\\'s shadow. Books are the mirrors of the soul. I donâ€™t know if youâ€™ve ever felt like that. That you wanted to sleep for a thousand years. Or just not exist. Or just not be aware that you do exist. Or something like that. I think wanting that is very morbid, but I want it when I get like this. Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m trying not to think. I just want it all to stop spinning. Be careful of love. It\\'ll twist your brain around and leave you thinking up is down and right is wrong. If you look for perfection, you\\'ll never be content. I can feel Peeta press his forehead into my temple and he asks, \\'So now that you\\'ve got me, what are you going to do with me?\\' I turn into him. \\'Put you somewhere you can\\'t get hurt. I\\'ve got a stele we can use. Who wants to do me?\"\"A regrettable choice of words,\" muttered Magnus. It kills me sometimes, how people die. Blessed is he who expects nothing, for he shall never be disappointed. There is nothing in the world so irresistibly contagious as laughter and good humor. None but ourselves can free our minds. I did then what I knew how to do. Now that I know better, I do better. Unbeing dead isn\\'t being alive. Nobody likes being alone that much. I don\\'t go out of my way to make friends, that\\'s all. It just leads to disappointment.  Never say goodbye because goodbye means going away and going away means forgetting. Friendship is the hardest thing in the world to explain. It\\'s not something you learn in school. But if you haven\\'t learned the meaning of friendship, you really haven\\'t learned anything. Music was my refuge. I could crawl into the space between the notes and curl my back to loneliness. Don\\'t talk to me.\"\"Why not?\"\"Because I want to fix that in my memory for ever. Draco Malfoy, the amazing bouncing ferret... Fear cuts deeper than swords. Death must be so beautiful. To lie in the soft brown earth, with the grasses waving above one\\'s head, and listen to silence. To have no yesterday, and no tomorrow. To forget time, to forgive life, to be at peace. Even if you cannot change all the people around you, you can change the people you choose to be around. Life is too short to waste your time on people who donâ€™t respect, appreciate, and value you. Spend your life with people who make you smile, laugh, and feel loved. Why, sometimes I\\'ve believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast. People haven\\'t always been there for me but music always has. Life should not be a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body, but rather to skid in broadside in a cloud of smoke, thoroughly used up, totally worn out, and loudly proclaiming \"Wow! What a Ride! Many boys will bring you flowers. But someday you\\'ll meet a boy who will learn your favorite flower, your favorite song, your favorite sweet. And even if he is too poor to give you any of them, it won\\'t matter because he will have taken the time to know you as no one else does. Only that boy earns your heart. You cannot control the behavior of others, but you can always choose how you respond to it. War is what happens when language fails. I will not say: do not weep; for not all tears are an evil. Let no man pull you so low as to hate him. You know, Minister, I disagree with Dumbledore on many counts...but you cannot deny he\\'s got style... To go wrong in one\\'s own way is better than to go right in someone else\\'s. It is good to love many things, for therein lies the true strength, and whosoever loves much performs much, and can accomplish much, and what is done in love is well done. The world as we have created it is a process of our thinking. It cannot be changed without changing our thinking. He must have known I\\'d want to leave you.\"\"No, he must have known you would always want to come back. You can spend minutes, hours, days, weeks, or even months over-analyzing a situation; trying to put the pieces together, justifying what could\\'ve, would\\'ve happened... or you can just leave the pieces on the floor and move the fuck on. Let us step into the night and pursue that flighty temptress, adventure. Let us be grateful to the people who make us happy; they are the charming gardeners who make our souls blossom. All grown-ups were once children... but only few of them remember it. One of the Silent Brothers is here to see you. Hodge sent me to wake you up. Actually he offered to wake you himself, but since it\\'s 5 a.m., I figured you\\'d be less cranky if you had something nice to look at.\"\"Meaning you?\"\"What else? It\\'s all right to love someone who doesn\\'t love you back, as long as they\\'re worth you loving them. As long as they deserve it. God has no religion. I don\\'t want to repeat my innocence. I want the pleasure of losing it again. Love does not begin and end the way we seem to think it does. Love is a battle, love is a war; love is a growing up. You guessed? You must have been pretty sure, considering you could have killed me.\"\"I was ninety percent sure.\"\"I see,\" Clary said. There must have been something in her voice, because he turned to look at her. Her hand cracked across his face, a slap that rocked him back on his heels. He put his hands on his cheek, more in surprise than pain.\"What the hell was that for?\"\"The other ten percent. The truth is, unless you let go, unless you forgive yourself, unless you forgive the situation, unless you realize that the situation is over, you cannot move forward. Trust yourself. You know more than you think you do. It is amazing how complete is the delusion that beauty is goodness. Do what is right, not what is easy nor what is popular. Each friend represents a world in us, a world possibly not born until they arrive, and it is only by this meeting that a new world is born. Without deviation from the norm, progress is not possible. Clouds come floating into my life, no longer to carry rain or usher storm, but to add color to my sunset sky. Books are the plane, and the train, and the road. They are the destination, and the journey. They are home. Sometimes our light goes out, but is blown again into instant flame by an encounter with another human being. Life has no meaning. Each of us has meaning and we bring it to life. It is a waste to be asking the question when you are the answer. Fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself. How many slams in an old screen door? Depends how loud you shut it. How many slices in a bread? Depends how thin you cut it. How much good inside a day? Depends how good you live \\'em. How much love inside a friend? Depends how much you give \\'em. It is better to fail in originality than to succeed in imitation. When life gives you lemons, squirt someone in the eye. That\\'s the problem with drinking, I thought, as I poured myself a drink. If something bad happens you drink in an attempt to forget; if something good happens you drink in order to celebrate; and if nothing happens you drink to make something happen. If you want to be happy, do not dwell in the past, do not worry about the future, focus on living fully in the present. When love is not madness it is not love. I think... if it is true that there are as many minds as there are heads, then there are as many kinds of love as there are hearts. Iâ€™m here. I love you. I donâ€™t care if you need to stay up crying all night long, I will stay with you. If you need the medication again, go ahead and take itâ€I will love you through that, as well. If you donâ€™t need the medication, I will love you, too. Thereâ€™s nothing you can ever do to lose my love. I will protect you until you die, and after your death I will still protect you. I am stronger than Depression and I am braver than Loneliness and nothing will ever exhaust me. Once you can accept the universe as matter expanding into nothing that is something, wearing stripes with plaid comes easy. Why are they all staring?\" demanded Albus as he and Rose craned around to look at the other students.\"Donâ€™t let it worry you,\" said Ron. \"Itâ€™s me. Iâ€™m extremely famous. I cannot remember the books I\\'ve read any more than the meals I have eaten; even so, they have made me. People say nothing is impossible, but I do nothing every day. I hate to hear you talk about all women as if they were fine ladies instead of rational creatures. None of us want to be in calm waters all our lives. It is more fun to talk with someone who doesn\\'t use long, difficult words but rather short, easy words like \"What about lunch? It\\'s like everyone tells a story about themselves inside their own head. Always. All the time. That story makes you what you are. We build ourselves out of that story. There are wounds that never show on the body that are deeper and more hurtful than anything that bleeds. Vanity and pride are different things, though the words are often used synonymously. A person may be proud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us. A brave man acknowledges the strength of others. Women who seek to be equal with men lack ambition. Words can be like X-rays if you use them properly -- theyâ€™ll go through anything. You read and youâ€™re pierced. Do you think I am an automaton? â€ a machine without feelings? and can bear to have my morsel of bread snatched from my lips, and my drop of living water dashed from my cup? Do you think, because I am poor, obscure, plain, and little, I am soulless and heartless? You think wrong! â€ I have as much soul as you â€ and full as much heart! And if God had gifted me with some beauty and much wealth, I should have made it as hard for you to leave me, as it is now for me to leave you. I am not talking to you now through the medium of custom, conventionalities, nor even of mortal flesh: it is my spirit that addresses your spirit; just as if both had passed through the grave, and we stood at God\\'s feet, equal â€ as we are! Begin at the beginning,\" the King said, very gravely, \"and go on till you come to the end: then stop. It always shocked me when I realized that I wasnâ€™t the only person in the world who thought and felt such strange and awful things. Can I help you with something?\"Clary turned instant traitor against her gender. \"Those girls on the other side of the car are staring at you.\"Jace assumed an air of mellow gratification. \"Of course they are,\" he said, \"I am stunningly attractive. If you go home with somebody, and they don\\'t have books, don\\'t fuck \\'em! Some people have lives; some people have music. Finnick?\" I say, \"Maybe some pants?\"He looks down at his legs as if noticing his outfit for the first time. Then he whips off his hospital gown leaving him in just his underwear. \"Why? Do you find this\" -- he strikes a ridiculously provocative pose -- \"distracting?\"I laugh. Boggs looks embarrassed and Finnick looks more like the guy I met at the Quarter Quell The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. Be patient toward all that is unsolved in your heart and try to love the questions themselves, like locked rooms and like books that are now written in a very foreign tongue. Do not now seek the answers, which cannot be given you because you would not be able to live them. And the point is, to live everything. Live the questions now. Perhaps you will then gradually, without noticing it, live along some distant day into the answer. We are not necessarily doubting that God will do the best for us; we are wondering how painful the best will turn out to be. What you must understand about me is that Iâ€™m a deeply unhappy person. People think dreams aren\\'t real just because they aren\\'t made of matter, of particles. Dreams are real. But they are made of viewpoints, of images, of memories and puns and lost hopes. Tell the truth, or someone will tell it for you. If you like her, if she makes you happy, and if you feel like you know her---then don\\'t let her go. Rather than love, than money, than fame, give me truth. No person is your friend who demands your silence, or denies your right to grow. We live for books. Fantasy is escapist, and that is its glory. If a soldier is imprisioned by the enemy, don\\'t we consider it his duty to escape?. . .If we value the freedom of mind and soul, if we\\'re partisans of liberty, then it\\'s our plain duty to escape, and to take as many people with us as we can! The things you do for yourself are gone when you are gone, but the things you do for others remain as your legacy. The most beautiful people we have known are those who have known defeat, known suffering, known struggle, known loss, and have found their way out of the depths. These persons have an appreciation, a sensitivity, and an understanding of life that fills them with compassion, gentleness, and a deep loving concern. Beautiful people do not just happen. Dare to BeWhen a new day begins, dare to smile gratefully.When there is darkness, dare to be the first to shine a light.When there is injustice, dare to be the first to condemn it.When something seems difficult, dare to do it anyway.When life seems to beat you down, dare to fight back.When there seems to be no hope, dare to find some.When youâ€™re feeling tired, dare to keep going.When times are tough, dare to be tougher.When love hurts you, dare to love again.When someone is hurting, dare to help them heal.When another is lost, dare to help them find the way.When a friend falls, dare to be the first to extend a hand.When you cross paths with another, dare to make them smile.When you feel great, dare to help someone else feel great too.When the day has ended, dare to feel as youâ€™ve done your best.Dare to be the best you can â€At all times, Dare to be! Life becomes easier and more beautiful when we can see the good in other people. Iâ€™d said it before and meant it: Alive or undead, the love of my life was a badass. God will not look you over for medals, degrees or diplomas but for scars. The most painful thing is losing yourself in the process of loving someone too much, and forgetting that you are special too. Well, it seems to me that the best relationships - the ones that last - are frequently the ones that are rooted in friendship. You know, one day you look at the person and you see something more than you did the night before. Like a switch has been flicked somewhere. And the person who was just a friend is... suddenly the only person you can ever imagine yourself with. Some things don\\'t last forever, but some things do. Like a good song, or a good book, or a good memory you can take out and unfold in your darkest times, pressing down on the corners and peering in close, hoping you still recognize the person you see there. Art is the lie that enables us to realize the truth. Men always say that as the defining compliment, donâ€™t they? Sheâ€™s a cool girl. Being the Cool Girl means I am a hot, brilliant, funny woman who adores football, poker, dirty jokes, and burping, who plays video games, drinks cheap beer, loves threesomes and anal sex, and jams hot dogs and hamburgers into her mouth like sheâ€™s hosting the worldâ€™s biggest culinary gang bang while somehow maintaining a size 2, because Cool Girls are above all hot. Hot and understanding. Cool Girls never get angry; they only smile in a chagrined, loving manner and let their men do whatever they want. Go ahead, shit on me, I donâ€™t mind, Iâ€™m the Cool Girl.Men actually think this girl exists. Maybe theyâ€™re fooled because so many women are willing to pretend to be this girl. For a long time Cool Girl offended me. I used to see men â€ friends, coworkers, strangers â€ giddy over these awful pretender women, and Iâ€™d want to sit these men down and calmly say: You are not dating a woman, you are dating a woman who has watched too many movies written by socially awkward men whoâ€™d like to believe that this kind of woman exists and might kiss them. Iâ€™d want to grab the poor guy by his lapels or messenger bag and say: The bitch doesnâ€™t really love chili dogs that much â€ no one loves chili dogs that much! And the Cool Girls are even more pathetic: Theyâ€™re not even pretending to be the woman they want to be, theyâ€™re pretending to be the woman a man wants them to be. Oh, and if youâ€™re not a Cool Girl, I beg you not to believe that your man doesnâ€™t want the Cool Girl. It may be a slightly different version â€ maybe heâ€™s a vegetarian, so Cool Girl loves seitan and is great with dogs; or maybe heâ€™s a hipster artist, so Cool Girl is a tattooed, bespectacled nerd who loves comics. There are variations to the window dressing, but believe me, he wants Cool Girl, who is basically the girl who likes every fucking thing he likes and doesnâ€™t ever complain. (How do you know youâ€™re not Cool Girl? Because he says things like: â€œI like strong women.â€� If he says that to you, he will at some point fuck someone else. Because â€œI like strong womenâ€� is code for â€œI hate strong women.â€�) Think left and think right and think low and think high. Oh, the thinks you can think up if only you try! Do not fear to be eccentric in opinion, for every opinion now accepted was once eccentric. Mom says it\\'s because she has PMS.Do you even know what that means?\"I\\'m not a little kid anymore. It means pissed-at- men syndrome I suppose I\\'ll have to add the force of gravity to my list of enemies. Life is for the living.Death is for the dead.Let life be like music. And death a note unsaid. Only a true best friend can protect you from your immortal enemies. The only way to find true happiness is to risk being completely cut open. You may not control all the events that happen to you, but you can decide not to be reduced by them. If I were not a physicist, I would probably be a musician. I often think in music. I live my daydreams in music. I see my life in terms of music. If cats looked like frogs we\\'d realize what nasty, cruel little bastards they are. Style. That\\'s what people remember. The best way to find out if you can trust somebody is to trust them. There is no surer foundation for a beautiful friendship than a mutual taste in literature. Some cause happiness wherever they go; others whenever they go. There may be times when we are powerless to prevent injustice, but there must never be a time when we fail to protest. The most beautiful experience we can have is the mysterious. It is the fundamental emotion that stands at the cradle of true art and true science. A painter should begin every canvas with a wash of black, because all things in nature are dark except where exposed by the light. Some old wounds never truly heal, and bleed again at the slightest word. Declarations of love amuse me. Especially when unrequited. People aren\\'t born good or bad. Maybe they\\'re born with tendencies either way, but its the way you live your life that matters. Music is a total constant. That\\'s why we have such a strong visceral connection to it, you know? Because a song can take you back instantly to a moment, or a place, or even a person. No matter what else has changed in your or the world, that one song says the same, just like that moment. Donâ€™t grieve. Anything you lose comes round in another form. Investigation?\" Isabelle laughed. \"Now we\\'re detectives? Maybe we should all have code names.\"\"Good idea,\" said Jace. \"I shall be Baron Hotschaft Von Hugenstein. True love is rare, and it\\'s the only thing that gives life real meaning. The minute I heard my first love story,I started looking for you, not knowinghow blind that was.Lovers don\\'t finally meet somewhere.They\\'re in each other all along. I love you more than there are stars in the sky and fish in the sea. A woman\\'s heart should be so hidden in God that a man has to seek Him just to find her. The Guide says there is an art to flying\", said Ford, \"or rather a knack. The knack lies in learning how to throw yourself at the ground and miss. You smell good, too,â€� said PatchItâ€™s called a shower.â€� I was staring straight ahead. When he didnâ€™t answer, I turned sideways. â€œSoap. Shampoo. Hot water.â€�Naked. I know the drill. Dumbledore says people find it far easier to forgive others for being wrong than being right. In heaven, all the interesting people are missing. I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones. The scariest moment is always just before you start. It\\'s kind of fun to do the impossible. Do you think I\\'m pretty?I think you\\'re beautifulBeautiful?You are so beautiful, it hurts sometimes. What\\'s this?\" he demanded, looking from Clary to his companions, as if they might know what she was doing there.\"It\\'s a girl,\" Jace said,recovering his composure. \"Surely you\\'ve seen girls before, Alec. Your sister Isabelle is one. We know what we are, but not what we may be. Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?\"\"That depends a good deal on where you want to get to.\"\"I don\\'t much care where â€\"\"Then it doesn\\'t matter which way you go. Follow your inner moonlight; don\\'t hide the madness. Pain is temporary. Quitting lasts forever. You know,\" Gabriel said, \"there was a time I thought we could be friends, Will.\"\"There was a time I thought I was a ferret,\" Will said, \"but that turned out to be the opium haze. Did you know it had that effect? Because I didn\\'t. To define is to limit. I loved her against reason, against promise, against peace, against hope, against happiness, against all discouragement that could be. You have power over your mind - not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength. There is nothing noble in being superior to your fellow man; true nobility is being superior to your former self. Knowing others is intelligence;knowing yourself is true wisdom.Mastering others is strength; mastering yourself is true power. Worry does not empty tomorrow of its sorrow, it empties today of its strength. It has been said, \\'time heals all wounds.\\' I do not agree. The wounds remain. In time, the mind, protecting its sanity, covers them with scar tissue and the pain lessens. But it is never gone. Don\\'t be afraid of your fears. They\\'re not there to scare you. They\\'re there to let you know that something is worth it. There comes a time when one must take a position that is neither safe, nor politic, nor popular, but he must take it because conscience tells him it is right. Why is it,\" he said, one time, at the subway entrance, \"I feel I\\'ve known you so many years?\"\"Because I like you,\" she said, \"and I don\\'t want anything from you. I love you. Remember. They cannot take it A poem begins as a lump in the throat, a sense of wrong, a homesickness, a lovesickness. The most important kind of freedom is to be what you really are. You trade in your reality for a role. You trade in your sense for an act. You give up your ability to feel, and in exchange, put on a mask. There can\\'t be any large-scale revolution until there\\'s a personal revolution, on an individual level. It\\'s got to happen inside first. You pierce my soul. I am half agony, half hope...I have loved none but you. Three things in human life are important: the first is to be kind; the second is to be kind; and the third is to be kind. It\\'s not the load that breaks you down, it\\'s the way you carry it. I think we dream so we donâ€™t have to be apart for so long. If weâ€™re in each otherâ€™s dreams, we can be together all the time. The true soldier fights not because he hates what is in front of him, but because he loves what is behind him. I mean, if the relationship can\\'t survive the long term, why on earth would it be worth my time and energy for the short term? Nothing is so painful to the human mind as a great and sudden change. He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how. I have heard there are troubles of more than one kind. Some come from ahead and some come from behind. But I\\'ve bought a big bat. I\\'m all ready you see. Now my troubles are going to have troubles with me! Reading one book is like eating one potato chip. A woman has to live her life, or live to repent not having lived it. Cinderella? Snow White? What\\'s that? An illness? When I was a little girl I used to read fairy tales. In fairy tales you meet Prince Charming and he\\'s everything you ever wanted. In fairy tales the bad guy is very easy to spot. The bad guy is always wearing a black cape so you always know who he is. Then you grow up and you realize that Prince Charming is not as easy to find as you thought. You realize the bad guy is not wearing a black cape and he\\'s not easy to spot; he\\'s really funny, and he makes you laugh, and he has perfect hair. There\\'s plenty of sense in nonsense sometimes, if you wish to look for it. Do I not destroy my enemies when I make them my friends? Success is not how high you have climbed, but how you make a positive difference to the world. Even the darkest night will end and the sun will rise. If writers wrote as carelessly as some people talk, then adhasdh asdglaseuyt[bn[ pasdlgkhasdfasdf. You never fail until you stop trying. I was smiling yesterday,I am smiling today and I will smile tomorrow.Simply because life is too short to cry for anything. You\\'ll stay with me?\\'Until the very end,\\' said James. Thatâ€™s part of what I like about the book in some ways. It portrays death truthfully. You die in the middle of your life, in the middle of a sentence I read a book one day and my whole life was changed. Everything tells me that I am about to make a wrong decision, but making mistakes is just part of life. What does the world want of me? Does it want me to take no risks, to go back to where I came from because I didn\\'t have the courage to say \"yes\" to life? but for my own part, if a book is well written, I always find it too short. The most wasted of all days is one without laughter. Books are for people who wish they were somewhere else. Among other things, you\\'ll find that you\\'re not the first person who was ever confused and frightened and even sickened by human behavior. You\\'re by no means alone on that score, you\\'ll be excited and stimulated to know. Many, many men have been just as troubled morally and spiritually as you are right now. Happily, some of them kept records of their troubles. You\\'ll learn from themâ€if you want to. Just as someday, if you have something to offer, someone will learn something from you. It\\'s a beautiful reciprocal arrangement. And it isn\\'t education. It\\'s history. It\\'s poetry. The paradox of our time in history is that we have taller buildings but shorter tempers, wider Freeways, but narrower viewpoints. We spend more, but have less, we buy more, but enjoy less. We have bigger houses and smaller families, more conveniences, but less time. We have more degrees but less sense, more knowledge, but less judgment, more experts, yet more problems, more medicine, but less wellness.We drink too much, smoke too much, spend too recklessly, laugh too little, drive too fast, get too angry, stay up too late, get up too tired, read too little, watch TV too much, and pray too seldom. We have multiplied our possessions, but reduced our values. We talk too much, love too seldom, and hate too often.We\\'ve learned how to make a living, but not a life. We\\'ve added years to life not life to years. We\\'ve been all the way to the moon and back, but have trouble crossing the street to meet a new neighbor. We conquered outer space but not inner space. We\\'ve done larger things, but not better things.We\\'ve cleaned up the air, but polluted the soul. We\\'ve conquered the atom, but not our prejudice. We write more, but learn less. We plan more, but accomplish less. We\\'ve learned to rush, but not to wait. We build more computers to hold more information, to produce more copies than ever, but we communicate less and less.These are the times of fast foods and slow digestion, big men and small character, steep profits and shallow relationships.These are the days of two incomes but more divorce, fancier houses, but broken homes. These are days of quick trips, disposable diapers, throwaway morality, one night stands, overweight bodies, and pills that do everything from cheer, to quiet, to kill. It is a time when there is much in the showroom window and nothing in the stockroom. A time when technology can bring this letter to you, and a time when you can choose either to share this insight, or to just hit delete...Remember, to spend some time with your loved ones, because they are not going to be around forever. Remember, say a kind word to someone who looks up to you in awe, because that little person soon will grow up and leave your side.Remember, to give a warm hug to the one next to you, because that is the only treasure you can give with your heart and it doesn\\'t cost a cent.Remember, to say, \"I love you\" to your partner and your loved ones, but most of all mean it. A kiss and an embrace will mend hurt when it comes from deep inside of you.Remember to hold hands and cherish the moment for someday that person might not be there again. Give time to love, give time to speak! And give time to share the precious thoughts in your mind. All the darkness in the world cannot extinguish the light of a single candle. I believe the universe wants to be noticed. I think the universe is inprobably biased toward the consciousness, that it rewards intelligence in part because the universe enjoys its elegance being observed. And who am I, living in the middle of history, to tell the universe that it-or my observation of it-is temporary? Perhaps when we find ourselves wanting everything, it is because we are dangerously close to wanting nothing. She wasn\\'t bitter. She was sad, though. But it was a hopeful kind of sad. The kind of sad that just takes time.  Writing is a socially acceptable form of schizophrenia. Poets have been mysteriously silent on the subject of cheese. Laters, baby. Love is an irresistible desire to be irresistibly desired. If you want to forget something or someone, never hate it, or never hate him/her. Everything and everyone that you hate is engraved upon your heart; if you want to let go of something, if you want to forget, you cannot hate. How do you feel, Georgie?\" whispered Mrs. Weasley.George\\'s fingers groped for the side of his head.\"Saintlike,\" he murmured.\"What\\'s wrong with him?\" croaked Fred, looking terrified. \"Is his mind affected?\"\"Saintlike,\" repeated George, opening his eyes and looking up at his brother. \"You see...I\\'m HOLEY, Fred, geddit?

Albus Severus,\" Harry said quietly, so that nobody but Ginny could hear, and she was tactful enough to pretend to be waving to Rose, who was now on the train, \"you were named for two headmasters of Hogwarts. One of them was a Slytherin and he was probably the bravest man I ever knew. I don\\'t believe in the kind of magic in my books. But I do believe something very magical can happen when you read a good book. The more I see, the less I know for sure. There is no real ending. Itâ€™s just the place where you stop the story. There are no facts, only interpretations. No thief, however skillful, can rob one of knowledge, and that is why knowledge is the best and safest treasure to acquire. What is hell? I maintain that it is the suffering of being unable to love. I have the choice of being constantly active and happy or introspectively passive and sad. Or I can go mad by ricocheting in between. HopeSmiles from the threshold of the year to come, Whispering \\'it will be happier\\'...

You do not have to be good.You do not have to walk on your kneesfor a hundred miles through the desert, repenting.You only have to let the soft animal of your body love what it loves.Tell me about despair, yours, and I will tell you mine.Meanwhile the world goes on.Meanwhile the sun and the clear pebbles of the rainare moving across the landscapes,over the prairies and the deep trees,the mountains and the rivers.Meanwhile the wild geese, high in the clean blue air,are heading home again.Whoever you are, no matter how lonely,the world offers itself to your imagination,calls to you like the wild geese, harsh and exciting â€over and over announcing your placein the family of things. What would men be without women? Scarce, sir...mighty scarce. Youâ€™ve got about as much charm as a dead slug. Francois Rabelais. He was a poet. And his last words were \"I go to seek a Great Perhaps.\" That\\'s why I\\'m going. So I don\\'t have to wait until I die to start seeking a Great Perhaps. Youâ€™re wishinâ€™ too much, baby. You gotta stop wearing your wishbone where your backbone oughtta be. I felt my lungs inflate with the onrush of sceneryâ€air, mountains, trees, people. I thought, \"This is what it is to be happy. Don\\'t.\" Clary raised a warning hand. \"I\\'m not really in the mood right now.\"\"That\\'s got to be the first time a girl\\'s ever said that to me,\" Jace mused. It\\'s enough for me to be sure that you and I exist at this moment. Start writing, no matter what. The water does not flow until the faucet is turned on. All I ever wanted was to reach out and touch another human being not just with my hands but with my heart. Walk as if you are kissing the Earth with your feet. I fell in love with her courage, her sincerity, and her flaming self respect. And it\\'s these things I\\'d believe in, even if the whole world indulged in wild suspicions that she wasn\\'t all she should be. I love her and it is the beginning of everything. Pursue what catches your heart, not what catches your eyes. Of all forms of caution, caution in love is perhaps the most fatal to true happiness. Look again at that dot. That\\'s here. That\\'s home. That\\'s us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every \"superstar,\" every \"supreme leader,\" every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there-on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot.Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves.The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the moment the Earth is where we make our stand.It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we\\'ve ever known. It is a curious thought, but it is only when you see people looking ridiculous that you realize just how much you love them.

The Chinese use two brush strokes to write the word \\'crisis.\\' One brush stroke stands for danger; the other for opportunity. In a crisis, be aware of the danger--but recognize the opportunity. Don\\'t Panic. For me, trees have always been the most penetrating preachers. I revere them when they live in tribes and families, in forests and groves. And even more I revere them when they stand alone. They are like lonely persons. Not like hermits who have stolen away out of some weakness, but like great, solitary men, like Beethoven and Nietzsche. In their highest boughs the world rustles, their roots rest in infinity; but they do not lose themselves there, they struggle with all the force of their lives for one thing only: to fulfil themselves according to their own laws, to build up their own form, to represent themselves. Nothing is holier, nothing is more exemplary than a beautiful, strong tree. When a tree is cut down and reveals its naked death-wound to the sun, one can read its whole history in the luminous, inscribed disk of its trunk: in the rings of its years, its scars, all the struggle, all the suffering, all the sickness, all the happiness and prosperity stand truly written, the narrow years and the luxurious years, the attacks withstood, the storms endured. And every young farmboy knows that the hardest and noblest wood has the narrowest rings, that high on the mountains and in continuing danger the most indestructible, the strongest, the ideal trees grow. Trees are sanctuaries. Whoever knows how to speak to them, whoever knows how to listen to them, can learn the truth. They do not preach learning and precepts, they preach, undeterred by particulars, the ancient law of life. A tree says: A kernel is hidden in me, a spark, a thought, I am life from eternal life. The attempt and the risk that the eternal mother took with me is unique, unique the form and veins of my skin, unique the smallest play of leaves in my branches and the smallest scar on my bark. I was made to form and reveal the eternal in my smallest special detail. A tree says: My strength is trust. I know nothing about my fathers, I know nothing about the thousand children that every year spring out of me. I live out the secret of my seed to the very end, and I care for nothing else. I trust that God is in me. I trust that my labor is holy. Out of this trust I live. When we are stricken and cannot bear our lives any longer, then a tree has something to say to us: Be still! Be still! Look at me! Life is not easy, life is not difficult. Those are childish thoughts. Let God speak within you, and your thoughts will grow silent. You are anxious because your path leads away from mother and home. But every step and every day lead you back again to the mother. Home is neither here nor there. Home is within you, or home is nowhere at all. A longing to wander tears my heart when I hear trees rustling in the wind at evening. If one listens to them silently for a long time, this longing reveals its kernel, its meaning. It is not so much a matter of escaping from one\\'s suffering, though it may seem to be so. It is a longing for home, for a memory of the mother, for new metaphors for life. It leads home. Every path leads homeward, every step is birth, every step is death, every grave is mother. So the tree rustles in the evening, when we stand uneasy before our own childish thoughts: Trees have long thoughts, long-breathing and restful, just as they have longer lives than ours. They are wiser than we are, as long as we do not listen to them. But when we have learned how to listen to trees, then the brevity and the quickness and the childlike hastiness of our thoughts achieve an incomparable joy. Whoever has learned how to listen to trees no longer wants to be a tree. He wants to be nothing except what he is. That is home. That is happiness. Live to the point of tears. A good library will never be too neat, or too dusty, because somebody will always be in it, taking books off the shelves and staying up late reading them. When you stop expecting people to be perfect, you can like them for who they are. Stories never really end...even if the books like to pretend they do. Stories always go on. They don\\'t end on the last page, any more than they begin on the first page. Why didn\\'t I learn to treat everything like it was the last time. My greatest regret was how much I believed in the future. To see a World in a Grain of Sand And a Heaven in a Wild Flower, Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand And Eternity in an hour. When the power of love overcomes the love of power, the world will know peace. Remember that wherever your heart is, there you will find your treasure. After nourishment, shelter and companionship, stories are the thing we need most in the world. Find what you love and let it kill you. It was books that made me feel that perhaps I was not completely alone. They could be honest with me, and I with them. Just because you call an electric eel a rubber duck doesn\\'t make it a rubber duck, does it? And God help the poor bastard who decides they want to take a bath with the duckie. (Jace Wayland) Life is to be enjoyed, not endured There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others. My courage always rises at every attempt to intimidate me. Let everything happen to youBeauty and terrorJust keep goingNo feeling is final Learn what is to be taken seriously and laugh at the rest. It is the time you have wasted for your rose that makes your rose so important. A classic is a book that has never finished saying what it has to say. A book, too, can be a star, a living fire to lighten the darkness, leading out into the expanding universe. Now, you two â€ this year, you behave yourselves. If I get one more owl telling me you\\'ve â€ you\\'ve blown up a toilet or â€\"\"Blown up a toilet? We\\'ve never blown up a toilet.\"\"Great idea though, thanks, Mum. I go to seek a Great Perhaps. What are men to rocks and mountains? You can\\'t be happy unless you\\'re unhappy sometimes\". The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies but also to hate his friends. If you obey all of the rules, you miss all of the fun. Dwell on the beauty of life. Watch the stars, and see yourself running with them. I am not sure that I exist, actually. I am all the writers that I have read, all the people that I have met, all the women that I have loved; all the cities I have visited. Ah,â€� said a voice from the doorway, â€œhaving your annual â€˜everyone thinks Will is a lunaticâ€™ meeting, are you? â€œItâ€™s biannual,â€� said Jem. â€œAnd no, this is not that meeting. If no one in the entire world cared about you, did you really exist at all? Mom. I have something to tell you. Iâ€™m undead. Now, I know you may have some preconceived notions about the undead. I know you may not be comfortable with the idea of me being undead. But Iâ€™m here to tell you that undead are just like you and me â€¦ well, okay. Possibly more like me than you. How vain it is to sit down to write when you have not stood up to live. You\\'re off to Great Places!Today is your day!Your mountain is waiting,So... get on your way! History will be kind to me for I intend to write it. Hate the sin, love the sinner. I care for myself. The more solitary, the more friendless, the more unsustained I am, the more I will respect myself. Judge a man by his questions rather than by his answers. I lived in books more than I lived anywhere else. Holey? You have the the whole world of ear-related humor before you, you go for holey? I don\\'t want to be at the mercy of my emotions. I want to use them, to enjoy them, and to dominate them. What Is Love? I have met in the streets a very poor young man who was in love. His hat was old, his coat worn, the water passed through his shoes and the stars through his soul Some birds are not meant to be caged, that\\'s all. Their feathers are too bright, their songs too sweet and wild. So you let them go, or when you open the cage to feed them they somehow fly out past you. And the part of you that knows it was wrong to imprison them in the first place rejoices, but still, the place where you live is that much more drab and empty for their departure. And that\\'s the thing about people who mean everything they say. They think everyone else does too. You see, cuckoos are parasites. They lay their eggs in other birds\\' nests. When the egg hatches, the baby cuckoo pushes the other baby birds out of the nest. The poor parent birds work themselves to death trying to find enough food to feed the enormous cuckoo child who has murdered their babies and taken their places.\"\"Enormous?\" said Jace. \"Did you just call me fat?\"\"It was an analogy.\"\"I am not fat. Learn to light a candle in the darkest moments of someoneâ€™s life. Be the light that helps others see; it is what gives life its deepest significance. Well, nowIf little by little you stop loving meI shall stop loving youLittle by littleIf suddenly you forget meDo not look for meFor I shall already have forgotten youIf you think it long and mad the wind of banners that passes through my lifeAnd you decide to leave me at the shore of the heart where I have rootsRememberThat on that day, at that hour, I shall lift my armsAnd my roots will set off to seek another land Sanity and happiness are an impossible combination. We have to allow ourselves to be loved by the people who really love us, the people who really matter. Too much of the time, we are blinded by our own pursuits of people to love us, people that don\\'t even matter, while all that time we waste and the people who do love us have to stand on the sidewalk and watch us beg in the streets! It\\'s time to put an end to this. It\\'s time for us to let ourselves be loved. People who claim that they\\'re evil are usually no worse than the rest of us... It\\'s people who claim that they\\'re good, or any way better than the rest of us, that you have to be wary of. The reason it hurts so much to separate is because our souls are connected. You are imperfect, permanently and inevitably flawed. And you are beautiful. Great spirits have always encountered violent opposition from mediocre minds. He\\'s a wallflower. You see things. You keep quiet about them. And you understand. The silence depressed me. It wasn\\'t the silence of silence. It was my own silence. Out of the corner of her eye she thought she saw Jace shoot her a look of white rage - but when she glanced at him, he looked as he always did: easy, confident, slightly bored.\"In future, Clarissa,\" he said, \"it might be wise to mention that you already have a man in your bed, to avoid such tedious situations.\"\"You invited him into bed?\" Simon demanded, looking shaken.\"Ridiculous, isn\\'t it?\" said Jace. \"We would never have all fit.\"\"I didn\\'t invite him into bed,\" Clary snapped. \"We were just kissing.\"\"Just kissing?\" Jace\\'s tone mocked her with its false hurt. \"How swiftly you dismiss our love. We are all atheists about most of the gods that humanity has ever believed in. Some of us just go one god further. No matter how much suffering you went through, you never wanted to let go of those memories. Many people lose the small joys in the hope for the big happiness. All the world\\'s a stage, And all the men and women merely players; They have their exits and their entrances; And one man in his time plays many parts, His acts being seven ages. To burn with desire and keep quiet about it is the greatest punishment we can bring on ourselves. Usually I\\'m remarkably good natured. Try me on a day that doesn\\'t end in y. And I like large parties. Theyâ€™re so intimate. At small parties there isnâ€™t any privacy. And so it goes... Don\\'t say you don\\'t have enough time. You have exactly the same number of hours per day that were given to Helen Keller, Pasteur, Michelangelo, Mother Teresa, Leonardo da Vinci, Thomas Jefferson, and Albert Einstein. There was a clatter as the basilisk fangs cascaded out of Hermione\\'s arms. Running at Ron, she flung them around his neck and kissed him full on the mouth. Ron threw away the fangs and broomstick he was holding and responded with such enthusiasm that he lifted Hermione off her feet. \"Is this the moment?\" Harry asked weakly, and when nothing happened except that Ron and Hermione gripped each other still more firmly and swayed on the spot, he raised his voice. \"OI! There\\'s a war going on here!\" Ron and Hermione broke apart, their arms still around each other. \"I know, mate,\" said Ron, who looked as though he had recently been hit on the back of the head with a Bludger, \"so it\\'s now or never, isn\\'t it?\" \"Never mind that, what about the Horcrux?\" Harry shouted. \"D\\'you think you could just --- just hold it in, until we\\'ve got the diadem?\" \"Yeah --- right --- sorry ---\" said Ron, and he and Hermione set about gathering up fangs, both pink in the face. Nowadays people know the price of everything and the value of nothing. Tell your heart that the fear of suffering is worse than the suffering itself. And that no heart has ever suffered when it goes in search of its dreams, because every second of the search is a second\\'s encounter with God and with eternity. Be grateful for what you already have while you pursue your goals. If you arenâ€™t grateful for what you already have, what makes you think you would be happy with more. I dream my painting and I paint my dream. Forever is composed of nows. Once you have tasted flight, you will forever walk the earth with your eyes turned skyward, for there you have been, and there you will always long to return. Education is an admirable thing, but it is well to remember from time to time that nothing that is worth knowing can be taught. This is your life and its ending one moment at a time. If you are allergic to a thing, it is best not to put that thing in your mouth, particularly if the thing is cats. People are more difficult to work with than machines. And when you break a person, he can\\'t be fixed. The thing about growing up with Fred and George,\" said Ginny thoughtfully, \"is that you sort of start thinking anything\\'s possible if you\\'ve got enough nerve. Treat everyone with politeness and kindness, not because they are nice, but because you are. Things we lose have a way of coming back to us in the end, if not always in the way we expect. Books have a unique way of stopping time in a particular moment and saying: Letâ€™s not forget this. Start each day with a positive thought and a grateful heart. Believe in Your HeartBelieve in your heart that you\\'re meant to live a life full of passion, purpose, magic and miracles. That was the thing. You never got used to it, the idea of someone being gone. Just when you think it\\'s reconciled, accepted, someone points it out to you, and it just hits you all over again, that shocking. Both Rowling and Meyer, theyâ€™re speaking directly to young people. â€¦ The real difference is that Jo Rowling is a terrific writer and Stephenie Meyer canâ€™t write worth a darn. Sheâ€™s not very good. Reading is escape, and the opposite of escape; it\\'s a way to make contact with reality after a day of making things up, and it\\'s a way of making contact with someone else\\'s imagination after a day that\\'s all too real. A man can no more diminish God\\'s glory by refusing to worship Him than a lunatic can put out the sun by scribbling the word \\'darkness\\' on the walls of his cell. Never close your lips to those whom you have already opened your heart. If you have two friends in your lifetime, you\\'re lucky. If you have one good friend, you\\'re more than lucky. One love, one heart, one destiny. Stories may well be lies, but they are good lies that say true things, and which can sometimes pay the rent. If you gave someone your heart and they died, did they take it with them? Did you spend the rest of forever with a hole inside you that couldn\\'t be filled? I was within and without, simultaneously enchanted and repelled by the inexhaustible variety of life. The secret of health for both mind and body is not to mourn for the past, nor to worry about the future, but to live the present moment wisely and earnestly. Dance, when you\\'re broken open. Dance, if you\\'ve torn the bandage off. Dance in the middle of the fighting. Dance in your blood. Dance when you\\'re perfectly free. If she\\'s amazing, she won\\'t be easy. If she\\'s easy, she won\\'t be amazing. If she\\'s worth it, you wont give up. If you give up, you\\'re not worthy. ... Truth is, everybody is going to hurt you; you just gotta find the ones worth suffering for. The greater the love, the greater the tragedy when it\\'s over. It isn\\'t possible to love and part. You will wish that it was. You can transmute love, ignore it, muddle it, but you can never pull it out of you. I know by experience that the poets are right: love is eternal. The darker the night, the brighter the stars,  The deeper the grief, the closer is God! I will not let anyone walk through my mind with their dirty feet. Do you wish me a good morning, or mean that it is a good morning whether I want it or not; or that you feel good this morning; or that it is a morning to be good on? Finally, from so little sleeping and so much reading, his brain dried up and he went completely out of his mind. And on the subject of burning books: I want to congratulate librarians, not famous for their physical strength or their powerful political connections or their great wealth, who, all over this country, have staunchly resisted anti-democratic bullies who have tried to remove certain books from their shelves, and have refused to reveal to thought police the names of persons who have checked out those titles.So the America I loved still exists, if not in the White House or the Supreme Court or the Senate or the House of Representatives or the media. The America I love still exists at the front desks of our public libraries. There are no faster or firmer friendships than those formed between people who love the same books. Don\\'t take life too seriously. Punch it in the face when it needs a good hit. Laugh at it. What you do, the way you think, makes you beautiful. When someone is crying, of course, the noble thing to do is to comfort them. But if someone is trying to hide their tears, it may also be noble to pretend you do not notice them. I, myself, am made entirely of flaws, stitched together with good intentions. No amount of regretting can change the past, and no amount of worrying can change the future. The Road goes ever on and onDown from the door where it began.Now far ahead the Road has gone,And I must follow, if I can,Pursuing it with eager feet,Until it joins some larger wayWhere many paths and errands meet.And whither then? I cannot say The individual has always had to struggle to keep from being overwhelmed by the tribe. If you try it, you will be lonely often, and sometimes frightened. But no price is too high to pay for the privilege of owning yourself. Reality is that which, when you stop believing in it, doesn\\'t go away. When a man is denied the right to live the life he believes in, he has no choice but to become an outlaw. We have to continually be jumping off cliffs and developing our wings on the way down. Confront the dark parts of yourself, and work to banish them with illumination and forgiveness. Your willingness to wrestle with your demons will cause your angels to sing. Any fool can be happy. It takes a man with real heart to make beauty out of the stuff that makes us weep. Always do sober what you said you\\'d do drunk. That will teach you to keep your mouth shut. Do your thing and don\\'t care if they like it. Acts of Kindness:A random act of kindness, no matter how small, can make a tremendous impact on someone else\\'s life. So be sure when you step, Step with care and great tact. And remember that life\\'s A Great Balancing Act. And will you succeed? Yes! You will, indeed! (98 and Â¾ percent guaranteed) Kid, you\\'ll move mountains. If I should ever die, God forbid, let this be my epitaph:THE ONLY PROOF HE NEEDEDFOR THE EXISTENCE OF GODWAS MUSIC Why are women... so much more interesting to men than men are to women? I do things like get in a taxi and say, \"The library, and step on it. I was thinking about the first time I ever saw you,\" he said, \"and how after that I couldn\\'t forget you. I wanted to, but I couldn\\'t stop myself. I forced Hodge to let me be the one who came to find you and bring you back to the Institue. And even back then, in that stupid coffee shop, when I saw you sitting on that couch with Simon, even then that felt wrong to me-- I should have been the one sitting with you. The one who made you laugh like that. I couldn\\'t get rid of that feeling. That it should have been me. And the more I knew you, the more I felt it--it had never been like that for me before. I\\'d always wanted a girl and then gotten to know her and not wanted her anymore, but with you the feeling just got stronger and stronger until that night when you showed up at Renwick\\'s and I knew. And so with the sunshine and the great bursts of leaves growing on the trees, just as things grow in fast movies, I had that familiar conviction that life was beginning over again with the summer. A book must be the axe for the frozen sea within us. Solitude is fine but you need someone to tell that solitude is fine. If you\\'re lonely when you\\'re alone, you\\'re in bad company. Today a reader, tomorrow a leader. One cannot think well, love well, sleep well, if one has not dined well. Goodbye,\" said the fox. \"And now here is my secret, a very simple secret: It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye. But a mermaid has no tears, and therefore she suffers so much more. Is standing by the window muttering about blood something he does all the time?\" asked Simon.\"No,\" Jace said. \"Sometimes he sits on the couch and does it. It is a great thing to start life with a small number of really good books which are your very own. It\\'s not the face, but the expressions on it. It\\'s not the voice, but what you say. It\\'s not how you look in that body, but the thing you do with it. You are beautiful. Follow your heart, listen to your inner voice, stop caring about what others think.

War must be, while we defend our lives against a destroyer who would devour all; but I do not love the bright sword for its sharpness, nor the arrow for its swiftness, nor the warrior for his glory. I love only that which they defend. If you want to really hurt you parents, and you don\\'t have the nerve to be gay, the least you can do is go into the arts. I\\'m not kidding. The arts are not a way to make a living. They are a very human way of making life more bearable. Practicing an art, no matter how well or badly, is a way to make your soul grow, for heaven\\'s sake. Sing in the shower. Dance to the radio. Tell stories. Write a poem to a friend, even a lousy poem. Do it as well as you possible can. You will get an enormous reward. You will have created something. Sometimes it seems safer to hold it all in, where the only person who can judge is yourself. If you are irritated by every rub, how will your mirror be polished? Every generation imagines itself to be more intelligent than the one that went before it, and wiser than the one that comes after it. How wrong is it for a woman to expect the man to build the world she wants, rather than to create it herself? Trees are poems the earth writes upon the sky, We fell them down and turn them into paper,That we may record our emptiness. For last year\\'s words belong to last year\\'s language And next year\\'s words await another voice. After silence, that which comes nearest to expressing the inexpressible is music. Understanding is the first step to acceptance, and only with acceptance can there be recovery. Isabelle drifted over, Jace a pace behind her. She was wearing a long black dress with boots and an even longer cutaway coat of soft green velvet, the color of moss. \"I can\\'t believe you did it!\" she exclaimed. \"How did you get Magnus to let Jace leave?\"\"Traded him for Alec,\" Clary said.Isabelle looked mildly alarmed. \"Not permanently?\"\"No,\" said Jace. \"Just for a few hours. Unless I don\\'t come back,\" he added thoughtfully. \"In which case, maybe he does get to keep Alec. Think of it as a lease with an option to buy.\"Isabelle looked dubious. \"Mom and Dad won\\'t be pleased if they find out.\"\"That you freed a possible criminal by trading away your brother to a warlock who looks like a gay Sonic the Hedgehog and dresses like the Child Catcher from Chitty Chitty Bang Bang?\" Simon inquired. \"No, probably not. At some point, you just pull off the Band-Aid, and it hurts, but then it\\'s over and you\\'re relieved. And still, after all this time,The sun never says to the earth,\"You owe Me.\"Look what happens withA love like that,It lights the Whole Sky. Don\\'t be satisfied with stories, how things have gone with others. Unfold your own myth. Isn\\'t it odd how much fatter a book gets when you\\'ve read it several times?\" Mo had said...\"As if something were left between the pages every time you read it. Feelings, thoughts, sounds, smells...and then, when you look at the book again many years later, you find yourself there, too, a slightly younger self, slightly different, as if the book had preserved you like a pressed flower...both strange and familiar. Despite my ghoulish reputation, I really have the heart of a small boy. I keep it in a jar on my desk. You don\\'t remember what happened. What you remember becomes what happened. You\\'re not to be so blind with patriotism that you can\\'t face reality. Wrong is wrong, no matter who does it or says it. We are all alone, born alone, die alone, andâ€in spite of True Romance magazinesâ€we shall all someday look back on our lives and see that, in spite of our company, we were alone the whole way. I do not say lonelyâ€at least, not all the timeâ€but essentially, and finally, alone. This is what makes your self-respect so important, and I don\\'t see how you can respect yourself if you must look in the hearts and minds of others for your happiness. They say when you are missing someone that they are probably feeling the same, but I don\\'t think it\\'s possible for you to miss me as much as I\\'m missing you right now The world was hers for the reading. Love is not affectionate feeling, but a steady wish for the loved person\\'s ultimate good as far as it can be obtained. The first draft of anything is shit. Happiness is the consequence of personal effort. You fight for it, strive for it, insist upon it, and sometimes even travel around the world looking for it. You have to participate relentlessly in the manifestations of your own blessings. And once you have achieved a state of happiness, you must never become lax about maintaining it. You must make a mighty effort to keep swimming upward into that happiness forever, to stay afloat on top of it. As if you were on fire from within.The moon lives in the lining of your skin. The measure of intelligence is the ability to change. What makes the desert beautiful,\\' said the little prince, \\'is that somewhere it hides a well... When I was a boy of 14, my father was so ignorant I could hardly stand to have the old man around. But when I got to be 21, I was astonished at how much the old man had learned in seven years. Perhaps it\\'s impossible to wear an identity without becoming what you pretend to be. Oh well... I\\'d just been thinking, if you had died, you\\'d have been welcome to share my toilet. It happens to everyone as they grow up. You find out who you are and what you want, and then you realize that people you\\'ve known forever don\\'t see things the way you do. So you keep the wonderful memories, but find yourself moving on. I\\'m quite illiterate, but I read a lot.  We waste time looking for the perfect lover, instead of creating the perfect love. Time is a drug. Too much of it kills you. Maybe everâ€™body in the whole damn world is scared of each other. Is \\'fat\\' really the worst thing a human being can be? Is \\'fat\\' worse than \\'vindictive\\', \\'jealous\\', \\'shallow\\', \\'vain\\', \\'boring\\' or \\'cruel\\'? Not to me. If a book about failures doesn\\'t sell, is it a success? Imagine smiling after a slap in the face. Then think of doing it twenty-four hours a day. You were born with wings, why prefer to crawl through life? Wherever you go becomes a part of you somehow. The function of prayer is not to influence God, but rather to change the nature of the one who prays. When you do things from your soul, you feel a river moving in you, a joy. How did it get so late so soon? I am an excitable person who only understands life lyrically, musically, in whom feelings are much stronger as reason. I am so thirsty for the marvelous that only the marvelous has power over me. Anything I can not transform into something marvelous, I let go. Reality doesn\\'t impress me. I only believe in intoxication, in ecstasy, and when ordinary life shackles me, I escape, one way or another. No more walls. I can resist anything except temptation. Atticus told me to delete the adjectives and I\\'d have the facts. Life shrinks or expands in proportion to one\\'s courage. We can easily forgive a child who is afraid of the dark; the real tragedy of life is when men are afraid of the light. I would like to be the air that inhabits you for a moment only. I would like to be that unnoticed and that necessary. Maybe you can afford to wait. Maybe for you there\\'s a tomorrow. Maybe for you there\\'s one thousand tomorrows, or three thousand, or ten, so much time you can bathe in it, roll around it, let it slide like coins through you fingers. So much time you can waste it.But for some of us there\\'s only today. And the truth is, you never really know. Don\\'t stop there. I suppose there are also, what, vampires and werewolves and zombies?\"\"Of course there are. Although you mostly find zombies farther south, where the voudun priests are.\"\"What about mummies? Do they only hang around Egypt?\"\"Don\\'t be ridiculous. No one believes in mummies. Even death has a heart. One ought, every day at least, to hear a little song, read a good poem, see a fine picture, and, if it were possible, to speak a few reasonable words. You speak an infinite deal of nothing. It doesn\\'t interest me what you do for a living. I want to know what you ache for, and if you dare to dream of meeting your heart\\'s longing.It doesn\\'t interest me how old you are. I want to know if you will risk looking like a fool for love, for your dream, for the adventure of being alive. It doesn\\'t interest me what planets are squaring your moon. I want to know if you have touched the center of your own sorrow, if you have been opened by life\\'s betrayals or have become shriveled and closed from fear of further pain!I want to know if you can sit with pain, mine or your own, without moving to hide it or fade it, or fix it. I want to know if you can be with joy, mine or your own, if you can dance with wildness and let the ecstasy fill you to the tips of your fingers and toes without cautioning us to be careful, to be realistic, to remember the limitations of being human. It doesn\\'t interest me if the story you are telling me is true. I want to know if you can disappoint another to be true to yourself; if you can bear the accusation of betrayal and not betray your own soul; if you can be faithlessand therefore trustworthy. I want to know if you can see beauty even when it\\'s not pretty, every day,and if you can source your own life from its presence. I want to know if you can live with failure, yours and mine, and still stand on the edge of the lake and shout to the silver of the full moon, â€œYes!â€�It doesn\\'t interest me to know where you live or how much money you have. I want to know if you can get up, after the night of grief and despair, weary and bruised to the bone, and do what needs to be done to feed the children. It doesn\\'t interest me who you know or how you came to be here. I want to know if you will stand in the center of the fire with me and not shrink back. It doesn\\'t interest me where or what or with whom you have studied. I want to know what sustains you, from the inside, when all else falls away. I want to know if you can be alone with yourself and if you truly like the company you keep in the empty moments. All you have to do is write one true sentence. Write the truest sentence that you know. Sometimes, you read a book and it fills you with this weird evangelical zeal, and you become convinced that the shattered world will never be put back together unless and until all living humans read the book. And then there are books like An Imperial Affliction, which you can\\'t tell people about, books so special and rare and yours that advertising your affection feels like betrayal A cynic is a man who knows the price of everything, and the value of nothing. He does something to me, that boy. Every time. Itâ€™s his only detriment. He steps on my heart. He makes me cry. Gravitation is not responsible for people falling in love. You know, when it works, love is pretty amazing. It\\'s not overrated. There\\'s a reason for all those songs. To me, Fearless is not the absense of fear. It\\'s not being completely unafraid. To me, Fearless is having fears. Fearless is having doubts. Lots of them. To me, Fearless is living in spite of those things that scare you to death. But in the end one needs more courage to live than to kill himself. The moment you doubt whether you can fly, you cease for ever to be able to do it. Say \\'provoking\\' again. Your mouth looks provocative when you do. There are three types of lies -- lies, damn lies, and statistics. Words are easy, like the wind; Faithful friends are hard to find. I dream. Sometimes I think that\\'s the only right thing to do. Don\\'t be afraid of death; be afraid of an unlived life. You don\\'t have to live forever, you just have to live. The very least you can do in your life is figure out what you hope for. And the most you can do is live inside that hope. Not admire it from a distance but live right in it, under its roof. I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine. Don\\'t you think it\\'s better to be extremely happy for a short while, even if you lose it, than to be just okay for your whole life? I can listen no longer in silence. I must speak to you by such means as are within my reach. You pierce my soul. I am half agony, half hope. Tell me not that I am too late, that such precious feelings are gone for ever. I offer myself to you again with a heart even more your own than when you almost broke it, eight years and a half ago. Dare not say that man forgets sooner than woman, that his love has an earlier death. I have loved none but you. Unjust I may have been, weak and resentful I have been, but never inconstant. You alone have brought me to Bath. For you alone, I think and plan. Have you not seen this? Can you fail to have understood my wishes? I had not waited even these ten days, could I have read your feelings, as I think you must have penetrated mine. I can hardly write. I am every instant hearing something which overpowers me. You sink your voice, but I can distinguish the tones of that voice when they would be lost on others. Too good, too excellent creature! You do us justice, indeed. You do believe that there is true attachment and constancy among men. Believe it to be most fervent, most undeviating, in F. W.I must go, uncertain of my fate; but I shall return hither, or follow your party, as soon as possible. A word, a look, will be enough to decide whether I enter your father\\'s house this evening or never. Someone I loved once gave me a box full of darkness. It took me years to understand that this too, was a gift. You need to learn how to select your thoughts just the same way you select your clothes every day. This is a power you can cultivate. If you want to control things in your life so bad, work on the mind. That\\'s the only thing you should be trying to control. You will do foolish things, but do them with enthusiasm. Life appears to me too short to be spent in nursing animosity or registering wrongs. Don\\'t part with your illusions. When they are gone you may still exist, but you have ceased to live. You know what charm is: a way of getting the answer yes without having asked any clear question. You see things; you say, \\'Why?\\' But I dream things that never were; and I say \\'Why not? People say that life is the thing, but I prefer reading. â€ŽThough nobody can go back and make a new beginning... Anyone can start over and make a new ending. Yeah, Quirrell was a great teacher. There was just that minor drawback of him having Lord Voldemort sticking out of the back of his head! Never be afraid to trust an unknown future to a known God. Grover was sniffing the wind, looking nervous. He fished out his acorns and threw them into the sand, then played his pipes. They rearranged themselves in a pattern that made no sense to me, but Grover looked concerned. \"That\\'s us,\" he said. \"Those five nuts right there.\" \"Which one is me?\" I asked. \"The little deformed one,\" Zoe suggested. \"Oh, shut up. I love you like a fat kid loves cake! Tonight I can write the saddest linesI loved her, and sometimes she loved me too. There are darknesses in life and there are lights, and you are one of the lights, the light of all lights. We should consider every day lost on which we have not danced at least once. An expert is a person who has made all the mistakes that can be made in a very narrow field. I will have you without armor, Kaz Brekker. Or I will not have you at all. You might be poor, your shoes might be broken, but your mind is a palace. Itâ€™s probably not just by chance that Iâ€™m alone. It would be very hard for a man to live with me, unless heâ€™s terribly strong. And if heâ€™s stronger than I, Iâ€™m the one who canâ€™t live with him. â€¦ Iâ€™m neither smart nor stupid, but I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m a run-of-the-mill person. Iâ€™ve been in business without being a businesswoman, Iâ€™ve loved without being a woman made only for love. The two men Iâ€™ve loved, I think, will remember me, on earth or in heaven, because men always remember a woman who caused them concern and uneasiness. Iâ€™ve done my best, in regard to people and to life, without precepts, but with a taste for justice. It was not the feeling of completeness I so needed, but the feeling of not being empty. Live in the present, remember the past, and fear not the future, for it doesn\\'t exist and never shall. There is only now. It is not that I\\'m so smart. But I stay with the questions much longer. I am a cage, in search of a bird. And when her lips met mine, I knew that I could live to be a hundred and visit every country in the world, but nothing would ever compare to that single moment when I first kissed the girl of my dreams and knew that my love would last forever. To say goodbye is to die a little. Welcome to the wonderful world of jealousy, he thought. For the price of admission, you get a splitting headache, a nearly irresistable urge to commit murder, and an inferiority complex. Yippee. Whatever the cost of our libraries, the price is cheap compared to that of an ignorant nation. Don\\'t feel bad, I\\'m usually about to die. I\\'m sure the universe is full of intelligent life. It\\'s just been too intelligent to come here. The best books... are those that tell you what you know already. Letting go means to come to the realization that some people are a part of your history, but not a part of your destiny. There are years that ask questions and years that answer. When I discover who I am, Iâ€™ll be free. We are just an advanced breed of monkeys on a minor planet of a very average star. But we can understand the Universe. That makes us something very special. You here to finish me off, Sweetheart? Look after my heart - I\\'ve left it with you. Growing apart doesn\\'t change the fact that for a long time we grew side by side; our roots will always be tangled. I\\'m glad for that. If you ever find yourself in the wrong story, leave. The purpose of life is not to be happy. It is to be useful, to be honorable, to be compassionate, to have it make some difference that you have lived and lived well. The beginning of love is the will to let those we love be perfectly themselves, the resolution not to twist them to fit our own image. If in loving them we do not love what they are, but only their potential likeness to ourselves, then we do not love them: we only love the reflection of ourselves we find in them If you want to be a writer, you must do two things above all others: read a lot and write a lot. I can shake off everything as I write; my sorrows disappear, my courage is reborn. Success is getting what you want, happiness is wanting what you get Many a book is like a key to unknown chambers within the castle of oneâ€™s own self. Don\\'t bend; don\\'t water it down; don\\'t try to make it logical; don\\'t edit your own soul according to the fashion. Rather, follow your most intense obsessions mercilessly. Suffering has been stronger than all other teaching, and has taught me to understand what your heart used to be. I have been bent and broken, but - I hope - into a better shape. The most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or touched, they are felt with the heart. So you\\'re always honest,\" I said.\"Aren\\'t you?\"\"No,\" I told him. \"I\\'m not.\"\"Well, that\\'s good to know, I guess.\"\"I\\'m not saying I\\'m a liar,\" I told him. He raised his eyebrows. \"That\\'s not how I meant it, anyways.\"\"How\\'d you mean it, then?\"\"I just...I don\\'t always say what I feel.\"\"Why not?\"\"Because the truth sometimes hurts,\" I said.\"Yeah,\" he said. \"So do lies, though. The meek may inherit the earth, but at the moment it belongs to the conceited. Like me. If you do not tell the truth about yourself you cannot tell it about other people. Books should go where they will be most appreciated, and not sit unread, gathering dust on a forgotten shelf, don\\'t you agree? Love is an untamed force. When we try to control it, it destroys us. When we try to imprison it, it enslaves us. When we try to understand it, it leaves us feeling lost and confused. When we are tired, we are attacked by ideas we conquered long ago. So it\\'s you and a syringe against the Capitol? See, this is why no one lets you make the plans. You must make a decision that you are going to move on. It wont happen automatically. You will have to rise up and say, â€˜I donâ€™t care how hard this is, I donâ€™t care how disappointed I am, Iâ€™m not going to let this get the best of me. Iâ€™m moving on with my life. Words are pale shadows of forgotten names. As names have power, words have power. Words can light fires in the minds of men. Words can wring tears from the hardest hearts. Be brave to stand for what you believe in even if you stand alone. The best moments in reading are when you come across something â€ a thought, a feeling, a way of looking at things â€ which you had thought special and particular to you. Now here it is, set down by someone else, a person you have never met, someone even who is long dead. And it is as if a hand has come out and taken yours. I crave your mouth, your voice, your hair.Silent and starving, I prowl through the streets. Bread does not nourish me, dawn disrupts me, all day I hunt for the liquid measure of your steps. I hunger for your sleek laugh, your hands the color of a savage harvest, hunger for the pale stones of your fingernails, I want to eat your skin like a whole almond. I want to eat the sunbeam flaring in your lovely body, the sovereign nose of your arrogant face, I want to eat the fleeting shade of your lashes, and I pace around hungry, sniffing the twilight, hunting for you, for your hot heart, Like a puma in the barrens of Quitratue. If you want to tell people the truth, make them laugh, otherwise they\\'ll kill you. Clary, Despite everything, I can\\'t bear the thought of this ring being lost forever, any more then I can bear the thought of leaving you forever. And though I have no choice about the one, at least I can choose about the other. I\\'m leaving you our family ring because you have as much right to it as I do.I\\'m writing this watching the sun come up. You\\'re asleep, dreams moving behind your restless eyelids. I wish I knew what you were thinking. I wish I could slip into your head and see the world the way you do. I wish I could see myself the way you do. But maybe I dont want to see that. Maybe it would make me feel even more than I already do that I\\'m perpetuating some kind of Great Lie on you, and I couldn\\'t stand that. I belong to you. You could do anything you wanted with me and I would let you. You could ask anything of me and I\\'d break myself trying to make you happy. My heart tells me this is the best and greatest feeling I have ever had. But my mind knows the difference between wanting what you can\\'t have and wanting what you shouldn\\'t want. And I shouldn\\'t want you.All night I\\'ve watched you sleeping, watched the moonlight come and go, casting its shadows across your face in black and white. I\\'ve never seen anything more beautiful. I think of the life we could have had if things were different, a life where this night is not a singular event, separate from everything else that\\'s real, but every night. But things aren\\'t different, and I can\\'t look at you without feeling like I\\'ve tricked you into loving me.The truth no one is willing to say out loud is that no one has a shot against Valentine but me. I can get close to him like no one else can. I can pretend I want to join him and he\\'ll believe me, up until that last moment where I end it all, one way or another. I have something of Sebastian\\'s; I can track him to where my father\\'s hiding, and that\\'s what I\\'m going to do. So I lied to you last night. I said I just wanted one night with you. But I want every night with you. And that\\'s why I have to slip out of your window now, like a coward. Because if I had to tell you this to your face, I couldn\\'t make myself go. I don\\'t blame you if you hate me, I wish you would. As long as I can still dream, I will dream of you. _Jace Have you ever noticed that anybody driving slower than you is an idiot, and anyone going faster than you is a maniac? If I got rid of my demons, Iâ€™d lose my angels. Don\\'t feel sorry for yourself. Only assholes do that. He smiled understandingly-much more than understandingly. It was one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that you may come across four or five times in life. It faced--or seemed to face--the whole eternal world for an instant, and then concentrated on you with an irresistible prejudice in your favor. It understood you just as far as you wanted to be understood, believed in you as you would like to believe in yourself, and assured you that it had precisely the impression of you that, at your best, you hoped to convey. The only way to get through life is to laugh your way through it. You either have to laugh or cry. I prefer to laugh. Crying gives me a headache. How do you spell \\'love\\'?\" - Piglet\"You don\\'t spell it...you feel it.\" - Pooh It\\'s just that most really good-looking people are stupid, so I exceed expectations.\\'\\'Right, it\\'s primarily his hotness,\\' I said.\\'It can be sort of blinding,\\' he said.\\'It actually did blind our friend Isaac,\\' I said.\\'Terrible tragedy, that. But can I help my own deadly beauty?\\'\\'You cannot.\\'\\'It is my burden, this beautiful face.\\'\\'Not to mention your body.\\'\\'Seriously, don\\'t even get me started on my hot bod. You don\\'t want to see me naked, Dave. Seeing me naked actually took Hazel Grace\\'s breath away,\\' he said, nodding toward the oxygen tank. Life, he realize, was much like a song. In the beginning there is mystery, in the end there is confirmation, but it\\'s in the middle where all the emotion resides to make the whole thing worthwhile. I wasn\\'t actually in love, but I felt a sort of tender curiosity. Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedomsâ€to choose oneâ€™s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose oneâ€™s own way. Education is the ability to listen to almost anything without losing your temper or your self-confidence. You can\\'t measure the mutual affection of two human beings by the number of words they exchange. You couldn\\'t relive your life, skipping the awful parts, without losing what made it worthwhile. You had to accept it as a whole--like the world, or the person you loved. â€ŽLife is a shipwreck, but we must not forget to sing in the lifeboats. Happiness [is] only real when shared There are three rules for writing a novel. Unfortunately, no one knows what they are. Travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry, and narrow-mindedness, and many of our people need it sorely on these accounts. Broad, wholesome, charitable views of men and things cannot be acquired by vegetating in one little corner of the earth all one\\'s lifetime. Love is a temporary madness, it erupts like volcanoes and then subsides. And when it subsides, you have to make a decision. You have to work out whether your roots have so entwined together that it is inconceivable that you should ever part. Because this is what love is. Love is not breathlessness, it is not excitement, it is not the promulgation of promises of eternal passion, it is not the desire to mate every second minute of the day, it is not lying awake at night imagining that he is kissing every cranny of your body. No, don\\'t blush, I am telling you some truths. That is just being \"in love\", which any fool can do. Love itself is what is left over when being in love has burned away, and this is both an art and a fortunate accident. That it will never come again is what makes life so sweet. People demand freedom of speech as a compensation for the freedom of thought which they seldom use. It\\'s been my experience that you can nearly always enjoy things if you make up your mind firmly that you will. No woman really wants a man to carry her off; she only wants him to want to do it. Every great love starts with a great story... But I don\\'t want comfort. I want God, I want poetry, I want real danger, I want freedom, I want goodness. I want sin. Time is an illusion. Lunchtime doubly so. Hello babies. Welcome to Earth. It\\'s hot in the summer and cold in the winter. It\\'s round and wet and crowded. On the outside, babies, you\\'ve got a hundred years here. There\\'s only one rule that I know of, babies-\"God damn it, you\\'ve got to be kind. He thinks he\\'ll be remembered as the villain in the story. But I forgot to tell him that the villain is usually the person who locks up the maiden and throws away the key. He was the one who let me out. There is no mistaking a real book when one meets it. It is like falling in love. When we are no longer able to change a situation, we are challenged to change ourselves. The past has no power over the present moment. Every man I meet wants to protect me. I can\\'t figure out what from. In politics, If you want anything said, ask a man. If you want anything done, ask a woman. It\\'s a lot easier to be lost than found. It\\'s the reason we\\'re always searching and rarely discovered--so many locks not enough keys. Reading furnishes the mind only with materials of knowledge; it is thinking that makes what we read ours. Maybe...you\\'ll fall in love with me all over again.\"\"Hell,\" I said, \"I love you enough now. What do you want to do? Ruin me?\"\"Yes. I want to ruin you.\"\"Good,\" I said. \"That\\'s what I want too. Why were you lurking under our window?\"\"Yes - yes, good point, Petunia! What were you doing under our windows, boy?\"\"Listening to the news,\" said Harry in a resigned voice.His aunt and uncle exchanged looks of outrage.\"Listening to the news! Again?\"\"Well, it changes every day, you see,\" said Harry. You never know what worse luck your bad luck has saved you from. Knock, And He\\'ll open the doorVanish, And He\\'ll make you shine like the sunFall, And He\\'ll raise you to the heavensBecome nothing, And He\\'ll turn you into everything. You will lose someone you canâ€™t live without,and your heart will be badly broken, and the bad news is that you never completely get over the loss of your beloved. But this is also the good news. They live forever in your broken heart that doesnâ€™t seal back up. And you come through. Itâ€™s like having a broken leg that never heals perfectlyâ€that still hurts when the weather gets cold, but you learn to dance with the limp. Don\\'t waste your time with explanations: people only hear what they want to hear. I\\'m not young enough to know everything. It is forbidden to kill; therefore all murderers are punished unless they kill in large numbers and to the sound of trumpets. And I thought about how many people have loved those songs. And how many people got through a lot of bad times because of those songs. And how many people enjoyed good times with those songs. And how much those songs really mean. I think it would be great to have written one of those songs. I bet if I wrote one of them, I would be very proud. I hope the people who wrote those songs are happy. I hope they feel it\\'s enough. I really do because they\\'ve made me happy. And I\\'m only one person. One can never have enough socks,\" said Dumbledore. \"Another Christmas has come and gone and I didn\\'t get a single pair. People will insist on giving me books. I nodded, looking at Rachel with respect. \"You hit the Lord of the Titans in the eye with a blue plastic hairbrush. you can, you should, and if youâ€™re brave enough to start, you will. I came from a real tough neighborhood. Once a guy pulled a knife on me. I knew he wasn\\'t a professional, the knife had butter on it. Some people say, â€œNever let them see you cry.â€� I say, if youâ€™re so mad you could just cry, then cry. It terrifies everyone. Biology gives you a brain. Life turns it into a mind. The heart is an arrow. It demands aim to land true. If you treat an individual as he is, he will remain how he is. But if you treat him as if he were what he ought to be and could be, he will become what he ought to be and could be. Literature is the most agreeable way of ignoring life. If you ask me what I came to do in this world, I, an artist, will answer you: I am here to live out loud. Though she be but little, she is fierce! Remember to always be yourself. Unless you suck. I could not tell you if I loved you the first moment I saw you, or if it was the second or third or fourth. But I remember the first moment I looked at you walking toward me and realized that somehow the rest of the world seemed to vanish when I was with you. When it is dark enough, you can see the stars. Books say: She did this because. Life says: She did this. Books are where things are explained to you; life is where things aren\\'t. I\\'m not surprised some people prefer books. I regret that it takes a life to learn how to live. All great and precious things are lonely. I cannot believe in a God who wants to be praised all the time. I\\'ve got nothing to do today but smile. A ship is safe in harbor, but that\\'s not what ships are for.

And then he gives me a smile that just seems so genuinely sweet with just the right touch of shyness that unexpected warmth rushes through me. It\\'s often just enough to be with someone. I don\\'t need to touch them. Not even talk. A feeling passes between you both. You\\'re not alone. If you don\\'t know, the thing to do is not to get scared, but to learn. The pessimist complains about the wind; the optimist expects it to change; the realist adjusts the sails. The real story of the Fleece: there were these two children of Zeus, Cadmus and Europa, okay? They were about to get offered up as human sacrifices, when they prayed to Zeus to save them. So Zeus sent this magical flying ram with golden wool, which picked them up in Greece and carried them all the way to Colchis in Asia Minor. Well, actually it carried Cadmus. Europa fell off and died along the way, but that\\'s not important.\"\"It was probably important to her. Crying is all right in its way while it lasts. But you have to stop sooner or later, and then you still have to decide what to do. I\\'m not going to wear a red dress,\" she said.\"It would look stunning, My Lady,\" she called.She spoke to the bubbles gathered on the surface of the water. \"If there\\'s anyone I wish to stun at dinner, I\\'ll hit him in the face. These violent delights have violent endsAnd in their triump die, like fire and powderWhich, as they kiss, consume What is that you express in your eyes? It seems to me more than all the print I have read in my life. She read books as one would breathe air, to fill up and live. Failure is the condiment that gives success its flavor. What if it lines up like it did in the Trojan War ... Athena versus Poseidon?\"\"I don\\'t know. But I just know that I\\'ll be fighting next to you.\"\"Why?\"\"Because you\\'re my friend, Seaweed Brain. Any more stupid questions? It was, he thought, the difference between being dragged into the arena to face a battle to the death and walking into the arena with your head held high. Some people, perhaps, would say that there was little to choose between the two ways, but Dumbledore knew - and so do I, thought Harry, with a rush of fierce pride, and so did my parents - that there was all the difference in the world. Letting go doesn\\'t mean that you don\\'t care about someone anymore. It\\'s just realizing that the only person you really have control over is yourself. I stood still, vision blurring, and in that moment, I heard my heart break. It was a small, clean sound, like the snapping of a flower\\'s stem. Clothes make the man. Naked people have little or no influence on society. We must be willing to let go of the life we planned so as to have the life that is waiting for us. Before you, Bella, my life was like a moonless night. Very dark, but there were stars, points of light and reason. ...And then you shot across my sky like a meteor. Suddenly everything was on fire; there was brilliancy, there was beauty. When you were gone, when the meteor had fallen over the horizon, everything went black. Nothing had changed, but my eyes were blinded by the light. I couldnâ€™t see the stars anymore. And there was no more reason, for anything. It is my belief... that the truth is generally preferable to lies. Any fool knows men and women think differently at times, but the biggest difference is this. Men forget, but never forgive; women forgive, but never forget. I cannot sleep unless I am surrounded by books. The unreal is more powerful than the real. Because nothing is as perfect as you can imagine it. Because its only intangible ideas, concepts, beliefs, fantasies that last. Stone crumbles. Wood rots. People, well, they die. But things as fragile as a thought, a dream, a legend, they can go on and on. If you can change the way people think. The way they see themselves. The way they see the world. You can change the way people live their lives. That\\'s the only lasting thing you can create. Dogs never bite me. Just humans. Life is a series of natural and spontaneous changes. Don\\'t resist them; that only creates sorrow. Let reality be reality. Let things flow naturally forward in whatever way they like. Rivers know this: there is no hurry. We shall get there some day. I\\'m so glad I live in a world where there are Octobers. The most common way people give up their power is by thinking they don\\'t have any. All the secrets of the world are contained in books. Read at your own risk. Better to be strong than pretty and useless. I realize only one person will be damaged beyond repair if Peeta dies. Me. Cowards die many times before their deaths; The valiant never taste of death but once. Of all the wonders that I yet have heard, It seems to me most strange that men should fear; Seeing that death, a necessary end, Will come when it will come. When I am with you, we stay up all night.When you\\'re not here, I can\\'t go to sleep.Praise God for those two insomnias!And the difference between them. Be with me always - take any form - drive me mad! only do not leave me in this abyss, where I cannot find you! Oh, God! it is unutterable! I can not live without my life! I can not live without my soul! You can\\'t depend on your eyes when your imagination is out of focus. A DEFINITION NOT FOUNDIN THE DICTIONARYNot leaving: an act of trust and love,often deciphered by children A writer is someone for whom writing is more difficult than it is for other people. Sometimes when I\\'m talking, my words can\\'t keep up with my thoughts. I wonder why we think faster than we speak. Probably so we can think twice. Was it hard?\" I ask.Letting go?\"Not as hard as holding on to something that wasn\\'t real. People can lose their lives in libraries. They ought to be warned. Great things happen to those who don\\'t stop believing, trying, learning, and being grateful. The reasonable man adapts himself to the world: the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man. You will find that it is necessary to let things go; simply for the reason that they are heavy. So let them go, let go of them. I tie no weights to my ankles. From the moment I picked up your book until I put it down, I was convulsed with laughter. Some day I intend reading it. Tears shed for another person are not a sign of weakness. They are a sign of a pure heart. Children must be taught how to think, not what to think. There is no exquisite beautyâ€¦ without some strangeness in the proportion. Of all the trees we could\\'ve hit, we had to get one that hits back. Everyone is a moon, and has a dark side which he never shows to anybody. I think there\\'s just one kind of folks. Folks. The one thing we can never get enough of is love. And the one thing we never give enough of is love. Maybe everyone can live beyond what they\\'re capable of. Do not fear failure but rather fear not trying. A common mistake that people make when trying to design something completely foolproof is to underestimate the ingenuity of complete fools. A learning experience is one of those things that says, \\'You know that thing you just did? Don\\'t do that. Don\\'t tell me,\" Jace said, \"Simon\\'s turned himself into an ocelot and you want me to do something about it before Isabelle makes him into a stole. Well, you\\'ll have have to wait till tomorrow. I\\'m out of commission.\" He pointed at himself - he was wearing blue pajamas with a hole in the sleeve. \"Look. Jammies.\"\"Jace,\" Clary said, \"this is important.\"\"Don\\'t tell me,\" he said. \"You\\'ve got a drawing emergency. You need a nude model. Well, I\\'m not in the mood. You could always ask Hodge,\" he said as an afterthought. \"I hear he\\'ll do anything for a -\"\"JACE!\" she interrupted him, her voice rising to a scream. \"JUST SHUT UP FOR A SECOND AND LISTEN, WILL YOU? Stay gold, Ponyboy. Stay gold . . .â€� The pillow seemed to sink a little, and Johnny died. Never lose hope. Storms make people stronger and never last forever. I shut my eyes and all the world drops dead; I lift my eyes and all is born again. The capacity for friendship is God\\'s way of apologizing for our families. The best thing for being sad,\" replied Merlin, beginning to puff and blow, \"is to learn something. That\\'s the only thing that never fails. You may grow old and trembling in your anatomies, you may lie awake at night listening to the disorder of your veins, you may miss your only love, you may see the world about you devastated by evil lunatics, or know your honour trampled in the sewers of baser minds. There is only one thing for it then â€ to learn. Learn why the world wags and what wags it. That is the only thing which the mind can never exhaust, never alienate, never be tortured by, never fear or distrust, and never dream of regretting. Learning is the only thing for you. Look what a lot of things there are to learn. If you pick up a starving dog and make him prosperous he will not bite you. This is the principal difference between a dog and man. I\\'m tough, I\\'m ambitious, and I know exactly what I want. If that makes me a bitch, okay. You realize that our mistrust of the future makes it hard to give up the past. The clearest way into the Universe is through a forest wilderness. Have no fear of perfection - you\\'ll never reach it. He stepped down, trying not to look long at her, as if she were the sun, yet he saw her, like the sun, even without looking. You wanna fly, you got to give up the shit that weighs you down. Even if you are on the right track, youâ€™ll get run over if you just sit there. Don\\'t Gain The World & Lose Your Soul, Wisdom Is Better Than Silver Or Gold. When people don\\'t express themselves, they die one piece at a time. A good traveler has no fixed plans and is not intent on arriving. It\\'s amazing how a little tomorrow can make up for a whole lot of yesterday. Great minds are always feared by lesser minds. To be, or not to be: that is the question:Whether \\'tis nobler in the mind to sufferThe slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep;No more; and by a sleep to say we endThe heart-ache and the thousand natural shocksThat flesh is heir to, \\'tis a consummationDevoutly to be wish\\'d. To die, to sleep;To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there\\'s the rub;For in that sleep of death what dreams may comeWhen we have shuffled off this mortal coil,Must give us pause: there\\'s the respectThat makes calamity of so long life;For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,The oppressor\\'s wrong, the proud man\\'s contumely,The pangs of despised love, the law\\'s delay,The insolence of office and the spurnsThat patient merit of the unworthy takes,When he himself might his quietus makeWith a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear,To grunt and sweat under a weary life,But that the dread of something after death,The undiscover\\'d country from whose bournNo traveller returns, puzzles the willAnd makes us rather bear those ills we haveThan fly to others that we know not of?Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;And thus the native hue of resolutionIs sicklied o\\'er with the pale cast of thought,And enterprises of great pith and momentWith this regard their currents turn awry,And lose the name of action.--Soft you now!The fair Ophelia! Nymph, in thy orisonsBe all my sins remember\\'d! I loved you like a man loves a woman he never touches, only writes to, keeps little photographs of. Every one of us is, in the cosmic perspective, precious. If a human disagrees with you, let him live. In a hundred billion galaxies, you will not find another. Three may keep a secret, if two of them are dead. And when at last you find someone to whom you feel you can pour out your soul, you stop in shock at the words you utterâ€ they are so rusty, so ugly, so meaningless and feeble from being kept in the small cramped dark inside you so long. love the life you live.live the life you love. Sometimes it\\'s a form of love just to talk to somebody that you have nothing in common with and still be fascinated by their presence. Music expresses that which cannot be said and on which it is impossible to be silent. It\\'s discouraging to think how many people are shocked by honesty and how few by deceit. It\\'s funny how humans can wrap their mind around things and fit them into their version of reality. Knowledge speaks, but wisdom listens Every now and then I like to do as I\\'m told, just to confuse people. I have absolutely no pleasure in the stimulants in which I sometimes so madly indulge. It has not been in the pursuit of pleasure that I have periled life and reputation and reason. It has been the desperate attempt to escape from torturing memories, from a sense of insupportable loneliness and a dread of some strange impending doom. You endure what is unbearable, and you bear it. That is all. The best portion of a good man\\'s life: his little, nameless unremembered acts of kindness and love. Do you want to know who you are? Don\\'t ask. Act! Action will delineate and define you. You can cut all the flowers but you cannot keep Spring from coming. I am trying here to prevent anyone saying the really foolish thing that people often say about Him: Iâ€™m ready to accept Jesus as a great moral teacher, but I donâ€™t accept his claim to be God. That is the one thing we must not say. A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things Jesus said would not be a great moral teacher. He would either be a lunatic â€ on the level with the man who says he is a poached egg â€ or else he would be the Devil of Hell. You must make your choice. Either this man was, and is, the Son of God, or else a madman or something worse. You can shut him up for a fool, you can spit at him and kill him as a demon or you can fall at his feet and call him Lord and God, but let us not come with any patronizing nonsense about his being a great human teacher. He has not left that open to us. He did not intend to. All women become like their mothers. That is their tragedy. No man does, and that is his. Let\\'s think the unthinkable, let\\'s do the undoable. Let us prepare to grapple with the ineffable itself, and see if we may not eff it after all. Always find opportunities to make someone smile, and to offer random acts of kindness in everyday life. Yesterday is gone. Tomorrow has not yet come. We have only today. Let us begin. Science and religion are not at odds. Science is simply too young to understand. My Best Friend is a person who will give me a book I have not read. He was my mum and dad\\'s best friend. He\\'s a convicted murderer, but he\\'s broken out of wizard prison and he\\'s on the run. He likes to keep in touch with me, though...keep up with my news...check if I\\'m happy... Out of suffering have emerged the strongest souls; the most massive characters are seared with scars. Success is stumbling from failure to failure with no loss of enthusiasm. Anyone whose goal is \\'something higher\\' must expect someday to suffer vertigo. What is vertigo? Fear of falling? No, Vertigo is something other than fear of falling. It is the voice of the emptiness below us which tempts and lures us, it is the desire to fall, against which, terrified, we defend ourselves. Beauty is only skin deep, but ugly goes clean to the bone. And he took her in his arms and kissed her under the sunlit sky, and he cared not that they stood high upon the walls in the sight of many. Anyone who falls in love is searching for the missing pieces of themselves. So anyone who\\'s in love gets sad when they think of their lover. It\\'s like stepping back inside a room you have fond memories of, one you haven\\'t seen in a long time. Sometimes when I look at you, I feel I\\'m gazing at a distant star. It\\'s dazzling, but the light is from tens of thousands of years ago.Maybe the star doesn\\'t even exist any more. Yet sometimes that light seems more real to me than anything. Is it so bad, then, to be misunderstood? Pythagoras was misunderstood, and Socrates, and Jesus, and Luther, and Copernicus, and Galileo, and Newton, and every pure and wise spirit that ever took flesh. To be great is to be misunderstood. Art and love are the same thing: Itâ€™s the process of seeing yourself in things that are not you. The only way that we can live, is if we grow. The only way that we can grow is if we change. The only way that we can change is if we learn. The only way we can learn is if we are exposed. And the only way that we can become exposed is if we throw ourselves out into the open. Do it. Throw yourself. And perhaps it is the greater grief, after all, to be left on earth when another is gone. We do not grow absolutely, chronologically. We grow sometimes in one dimension, and not in another; unevenly. We grow partially. We are relative. We are mature in one realm, childish in another. The past, present, and future mingle and pull us backward, forward, or fix us in the present. We are made up of layers, cells, constellations. Perhaps the greatest faculty our minds possess is the ability to cope with pain. Classic thinking teaches us of the four doors of the mind, which everyone moves through according to their need.First is the door of sleep. Sleep offers us a retreat from the world and all its pain. Sleep marks passing time, giving us distance from the things that have hurt us. When a person is wounded they will often fall unconscious. Similarly, someone who hears traumatic news will often swoon or faint. This is the mind\\'s way of protecting itself from pain by stepping through the first door.Second is the door of forgetting. Some wounds are too deep to heal, or too deep to heal quickly. In addition, many memories are simply painful, and there is no healing to be done. The saying \\'time heals all wounds\\' is false. Time heals most wounds. The rest are hidden behind this door.Third is the door of madness. There are times when the mind is dealt such a blow it hides itself in insanity. While this may not seem beneficial, it is. There are times when reality is nothing but pain, and to escape that pain the mind must leave reality behind. Last is the door of death. The final resort. Nothing can hurt us after we are dead, or so we have been told. Ah! There is nothing like staying at home, for real comfort. Would it save you a lot of time if I just gave up and went mad now? Don\\'t be so humble - you are not that great. A woman without a man is like a fish without a bicycle. I had already found that it was not good to be alone, and so made companionship with what there was around me, sometimes with the universe and sometimes with my own insignificant self; but my books were always my friends, let fail all else. My imagination functions much better when I don\\'t have to speak to people. Winter is coming. I have come to accept the feeling of not knowing where I am going. And I have trained myself to love it. Because it is only when we are suspended in mid-air with no landing in sight, that we force our wings to unravel and alas begin our flight. And as we fly, we still may not know where we are going to. But the miracle is in the unfolding of the wings. You may not know where you\\'re going, but you know that so long as you spread your wings, the winds will carry you. Stuff your eyes with wonder, he said, live as if you\\'d drop dead in ten seconds. See the world. It\\'s more fantastic than any dream made or paid for in factories. There are books of which the backs and covers are by far the best parts. A truth that\\'s told with bad intentBeats all the lies you can invent. What are all these?\" Clary asked.\"Vials of holy water, blessed knives, steel and silver blades,\" Jace said, piling the weapons on the floor beside him, \"electrum wire - not much use at the moment but it\\'s always good to have spares - silver bullets, charms of protetion, crucifixes, stars of David-\"\"Jesus,\" said Clary\"I doubt he\\'d fit.\"\"Jace.\" Clary was appalled. Anyway, I keep picturing all these little kids playing some game in this big field of rye and all. Thousands of little kids, and nobody\\'s around - nobody big, I mean - except me. And I\\'m standing on the edge of some crazy cliff. What I have to do, I have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff - I mean if they\\'re running and they don\\'t look where they\\'re going I have to come out from somewhere and catch them. That\\'s all I do all day. I\\'d just be the catcher in the rye and all. I know it\\'s crazy, but that\\'s the only thing I\\'d really like to be. What you do makes a difference, and you have to decide what kind of difference you want to make. One day you will kiss a man you can\\'t breathe without, and find that breath is of little consequence. Today was good. Today was fun. Tomorrow is another one. I am constantly torn between killing myself and killing everyone around me. Do I contradict myself?Very well then I contradict myself,(I am large, I contain multitudes.) If things start happening, don\\'t worry, don\\'t stew, just go right along and you\\'ll start happening too. The only way to get rid of temptation is to yield to it. Did you know that for pretty much the entire history of the human species, the average life span was less than thirty years? You could count on ten years or so of real adulthood, right? There was no planning for retirement, There was no planning for a career. There was no planning. No time for plannning. No time for a future. But then the life spans started getting longer, and people started having more and more future. And now life has become the future. Every moment of your life is lived for the future--you go to high school so you can go to college so you can get a good job so you can get a nice house so you can afford to send your kids to college so they can get a good job so they can get a nice house so they can afford to send their kids to college. This is what you shall do; Love the earth and sun and the animals, despise riches, give alms to every one that asks, stand up for the stupid and crazy, devote your income and labor to others, hate tyrants, argue not concerning God, have patience and indulgence toward the people, take off your hat to nothing known or unknown or to any man or number of men, go freely with powerful uneducated persons and with the young and with the mothers of families, read these leaves in the open air every season of every year of your life, re-examine all you have been told at school or church or in any book, dismiss whatever insults your own soul, and your very flesh shall be a great poem and have the richest fluency not only in its words but in the silent lines of its lips and face and between the lashes of your eyes and in every motion and joint of your body. If you don\\'t read the newspaper, you\\'re uninformed. If you read the newspaper, you\\'re mis-informed. Yes, frosting. The final defense of the dying. No one knows for certain how much impact they have on the lives of other people. Oftentimes, we have no clue. Yet we push it just the same. May the forces of evil become confused on the way to your house. Promise me you\\'ll never forget me because if I thought you would, I\\'d never leave. The worst part of success is trying to find someone who is happy for you. Youth is happy because it has the capacity to see beauty. Anyone who keeps the ability to see beauty never grows old. You possess other people\\'s...bodies.\"He accepted that statement with a nod.\"Do you want to possess my body?\"\"I want to do a lot of things to your body, but that\\'s not one of them. Still round the corner there may wait A new road or a secret gateAnd though I oft have passed them by A day will come at last when IShall take the hidden paths that run West of the Moon, East of the Sun. A good book is an event in my life. Once you had put the pieces back together, even though you may look intact, you were never quite the same as you\\'d been before the fall. being alone never felt right. sometimes it felt good, but it never felt right. She seems so cool, so focused, so quiet, yet her eyes remain fixed upon the horizon. You think you know all there is to know about her immediately upon meeting her, but everything you think you know is wrong. Passion flows through her like a river of blood. She only looked away for a moment, and the mask slipped, and you fell. All your tomorrows start here. You think my first instinct is to protect you. Because you\\'re small, or a girl, or a Stiff. But you\\'re wrong.\"He leans his face close to mine and wraps his fingers around my chin. His hand smells like metal. When was the last time he held a gun, or a knife? My skin tingles at the point of contact, like he\\'s transmitting electricity through his skin. \"My first instinct is to push you until you break, just to see how hard I have to press.\" he says, his fingers squeezing at the word break. My body tenses at the edge in his voice, so I am coiled as tight as a spring, and I forget to breathe.His dark eyes lifting to mine, he adds, \"But I resist it.\" \"Why...\" I swallow hard. \"Why is that your first instinct?\"\"Fear doesn\\'t shut you down; it wakes you up. I\\'ve seen it. It\\'s fascinating.\" He releases me but doesn\\'t pull away, his hand grazing my jaw, my neck. \"Sometimes I just want to see it again. Want to see you awake. A purpose of human life, no matter who is controlling it, is to love whoever is around to be loved. If I had a world of my own, everything would be nonsense. Nothing would be what it is, because everything would be what it isn\\'t. And contrary wise, what is, it wouldn\\'t be. And what it wouldn\\'t be, it would. You see? It is easier to forgive an enemy than to forgive a friend. I cannot teach anybody anything. I can only make them think It\\'s like Tolstoy said. Happiness is an allegory, unhappiness a story. People worry about kids playing with guns, and teenagers watching violent videos; we are scared that some sort of culture of violence will take them over. Nobody worries about kids listening to thousands - literally thousands - of songs about broken hearts and rejection and pain and misery and loss. Appear weak when you are strong, and strong when you are weak. A dream you dream alone is only a dream. A dream you dream together is reality. There are some things you can\\'t share without ending up liking each other, and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them. So when the moon\\'s only partly full, you only feel a little wolfy?\" \"You could say that.\"\"Well, you can go ahead and hang your head out the car window if you feel like it.\"\"I\\'m a werewolf, not a golden retriever. The library is inhabited by spirits that come out of the pages at night. I knew, in the silence that followed, that anything could happen here. It might be too late: again, I might have missed my chance. But I would at least know I tried, that I took my heart and extended my hand, whatever the outcome.\"Okay,\" he said. He took a breath. \"What would you do, if you could do anything?\"I took a step toward him, closing the space between us. \"This,\" I said. And then I kissed him. You yourself, as much as anybody in the entire universe, deserve your love and affection In a way, it\\'s nice to know that there are Greek gods out there, because you have somebody to blame when things go wrong. For instance, when you\\'re walking away from a bus that\\'s just been attacked by monster hags and blown up by lightning, and it\\'s raining on top of everything else, most people might think that\\'s just really bad luck; when you\\'re a half-blood, you understand that some devine force is really trying to mess up your day. For whatever we lose (like a you or a me),It\\'s always our self we find in the sea. Most books on witchcraft will tell you that witches work naked. This is because most books on witchcraft were written by men. The world is a dangerous place to live, not because of the people who are evil, but because of the people who don\\'t do anything about it. Love is the absence of judgment. Pain insists upon being attended to. God whispers to us in our pleasures, speaks in our consciences, but shouts in our pains. It is his megaphone to rouse a deaf world. One thing you can\\'t hide - is when you\\'re crippled inside. I\\'m not sentimental--I\\'m as romantic as you are. The idea, you know,is that the sentimental person thinks things will last--the romanticperson has a desperate confidence that they won\\'t. Your beliefs become your thoughts, Your thoughts become your words, Your words become your actions, Your actions become your habits, Your habits become your values, Your values become your destiny. Wisdom comes from experience. Experience is often a result of lack of wisdom. There is greatness in doing something you hate for the sake of someone you love. No matter what he does, every person on earth plays a central role in the history of the world. And normally he doesn\\'t know it. We can never judge the lives of others, because each person knows only their own pain and renunciation. It\\'s one thing to feel that you are on the right path, but it\\'s another to think that yours is the only path. Keep in mind that people change, but the past doesn\\'t. let me live, love, and say it well in good sentences Then I realize what it is. It\\'s him. Something about him makes me feel like I am about to fall. Or turn to liquid. Or burst into flames. I suppose a fire that burns that bright is not meant to last. Youth can not know how age thinks and feels. But old men are guilty if they forget what it was to be young. She leaned down and looked at his lifeless face and Leisel kissed her best friend, Rudy Steiner, soft and true on his lips. He tasted dusty and sweet. He tasted like regret in the shadows of trees and in the glow of the anarchist\\'s suit collection. She kissed him long and soft, and when she pulled herself away, she touched his mouth with her fingers...She did not say goodbye. She was incapable, and after a few more minutes at his side, she was able to tear herself from the ground. It amazes me what humans can do, even when streams are flowing down their faces and they stagger on... For what itâ€™s worth: itâ€™s never too late or, in my case, too early to be whoever you want to be. Thereâ€™s no time limit, stop whenever you want. You can change or stay the same, there are no rules to this thing. We can make the best or the worst of it. I hope you make the best of it. And I hope you see things that startle you. I hope you feel things you never felt before. I hope you meet people with a different point of view. I hope you live a life youâ€™re proud of. If you find that youâ€™re not, I hope you have the courage to start all over again. Silence make the real conversations between friends. Not the saying, but the never needing to say that counts. Our memory is a more perfect world than the universe: it gives back life to those who no longer exist. I\\'m saying that I\\'m a moody, insecure, narrow-minded, jealous, borderline homicidal bitch, and I want you to promise me that you\\'re okay with that, because it\\'s who I am, and you\\'re what I need. Always do what is right. It will gratify half of mankind and astound the other. You have to know what you stand for, not just what you stand against. The best fantasy is written in the language of dreams. It is alive as dreams are alive, more real than real ... for a moment at least ... that long magic moment before we wake. Fantasy is silver and scarlet, indigo and azure, obsidian veined with gold and lapis lazuli. Reality is plywood and plastic, done up in mud brown and olive drab. Fantasy tastes of habaneros and honey, cinnamon and cloves, rare red meat and wines as sweet as summer. Reality is beans and tofu, and ashes at the end. Reality is the strip malls of Burbank, the smokestacks of Cleveland, a parking garage in Newark. Fantasy is the towers of Minas Tirith, the ancient stones of Gormenghast, the halls of Camelot. Fantasy flies on the wings of Icarus, reality on Southwest Airlines. Why do our dreams become so much smaller when they finally come true? We read fantasy to find the colors again, I think. To taste strong spices and hear the songs the sirens sang. There is something old and true in fantasy that speaks to something deep within us, to the child who dreamt that one day he would hunt the forests of the night, and feast beneath the hollow hills, and find a love to last forever somewhere south of Oz and north of Shangri-La. They can keep their heaven. When I die, I\\'d sooner go to middle Earth. Who in the world am I? Ah, that\\'s the great puzzle. The snake which cannot cast its skin has to die. As well the minds which are prevented from changing their opinions; they cease to be mind. Your friend\\'s poetry is terrible,\" he said.Clary blinked, caught momentarily off guard. \"What?\"\"I said his poetry was terrible. It sounds like he ate a dictionary and started vomiting up words at random. I meant,\" said Ipslore bitterly, \"what is there in this world that truly makes living worthwhile?\"Death thought about it.CATS, he said eventually. CATS ARE NICE. Isn\\'t it enough to see that a garden is beautiful without having to believe that there are fairies at the bottom of it too? There was another life that I might have had, but I am having this one. But he who dares not grasp the thorn Should never crave the rose. I\\'ll just have them change the entry in the demonology textbook from \\'almost extinct\\' to \\'not extinct enough for Alec. He prefers his monsters really, really extinct.\\' Will that make you happy? Art enables us to find ourselves and lose ourselves at the same time. You should never be surprised when someone treats you with respect, you should expect it. To love oneself is the beginning of a lifelong romance. Respect was invented to cover the empty place where love should be. In a time of destruction, create something. Every time you smile at someone, it is an action of love, a gift to that person, a beautiful thing. People shouldn\\'t be afraid of their government. Governments should be afraid of their people. It is absurd to divide people into good and bad. People are either charming or tedious. It\\'s all in the view. That\\'s what I mean about forever, too. For any one of us our forever could end in an hour, or a hundred years from now. You never know for sure, so you\\'d better make every second count. Make your own Bible. Select and collect all the words and sentences that in all your readings have been to you like the blast of a trumpet. They who can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety. Name one hero who was happy.\"I considered. Heracles went mad and killed his family; Theseus lost his bride and father; Jason\\'s children and new wife were murdered by his old; Bellerophon killed the Chimera but was crippled by the fall from Pegasus\\' back.\"You can\\'t.\" He was sitting up now, leaning forward.\"I can\\'t.\"\"I know. They never let you be famous AND happy.\" He lifted an eyebrow. \"I\\'ll tell you a secret.\"\"Tell me.\" I loved it when he was like this.\"I\\'m going to be the first.\" He took my palm and held it to his. \"Swear it.\"\"Why me?\"\"Because you\\'re the reason. Swear it.\"\"I swear it,\" I said, lost in the high color of his cheeks, the flame in his eyes.\"I swear it,\" he echoed.We sat like that a moment, hands touching. He grinned.\"I feel like I could eat the world raw. In the beginning there was nothing, which exploded. And I asked myself about the present: how wide it was, how deep it was, how much was mine to keep. That\\'s why when major badasses greet each other in movies, they don\\'t say anything, they just nod. The nod means, \\'I\\' am a badass, and I recognize that you, too, are a badass,\\' but they don\\'t say anything because they\\'re Wolverine and Magneto and it would mess up their vibe to explain. Tess, Tess, Tessa. Was there ever a more beautiful sound than your name? To speak it aloud makes my heart ring like a bell. Strange to imagine that, isnâ€™t it â€ a heart ringing â€ but when you touch me that is what it is like: as if my heart is ringing in my chest and the sound shivers down my veins and splinters my bones with joy.Why have I written these words in this book? Because of you. You taught me to love this book where I had scorned it. When I read it for the second time, with an open mind and heart, I felt the most complete despair and envy of Sydney Carton. Yes, Sydney, for even if he had no hope that the woman he loved would love him, at least he could tell her of his love. At least he could do something to prove his passion, even if that thing was to die.I would have chosen death for a chance to tell you the truth, Tessa, if I could have been assured that death would be my own. And that is why I envied Sydney, for he was free.And now at last I am free, and I can finally tell you, without fear of danger to you, all that I feel in my heart.You are not the last dream of my soul.You are the first dream, the only dream I ever was unable to stop myself from dreaming. You are the first dream of my soul, and from that dream I hope will come all other dreams, a lifetimeâ€™s worth.With hope at least,Will Herondale Must you go? I was rather hoping you\\'d stay and be a ministering angel, but if you must go, you must.\"\"I\\'ll stay,\" Will said a bit crossly, and threw himself down in the armchair Tessa had just vacated. \"I can minister angelically.\"\"None too convincingly. And you\\'re not as pretty to look at as Tessa is,\" Jem said, closing his eyes as he leaned back against the pillow.\"How rude. Many who have gazed upon me have compared the experience to gazing at the radiance of the sun.\"Jem still had his eyes closed. \"If they mean it gives you a headache, they aren\\'t wrong. It does not matter how slowly you go as long as you do not stop. Light thinks it travels faster than anything but it is wrong. No matter how fast light travels, it finds the darkness has always got there first, and is waiting for it. Everything that irritates us about others can lead us to an understanding of ourselves. A girl should be two things: who and what she wants. Compassion is the basis of morality. There is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about. Everything has beauty, but not everyone sees it. I am too fond of reading books to care to write them. A half-read book is a half-finished love affair. Tell me and I forget, teach me and I may remember, involve me and I learn. Trust is like a mirror, you can fix it if it\\'s broken, but you can still see the crack in that mother fucker\\'s reflection. You can\\'t stop the futureYou can\\'t rewind the pastThe only way to learn the secret...is to press play. It wouldn\\'t be my move,\" Jace agreed. \"First the candy and flowers, then the apology letters, then the ravenous demon hordes. In that order. You can have it all. Just not all at once. People have forgotten this truth,\" the fox said. \"But you mustnâ€™t forget it. You become responsible forever for what youâ€™ve tamed. Youâ€™re responsible for your rose. Beautiful face. Beautiful body. Horrible attitude. It was the holy trinity of hot boys. But it is the nature of stars to cross, and never was Shakespeare more wrong than when he has Cassius note, â€˜The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars / But in ourselves. When the heart speaks, the mind finds it indecent to object. Confidence is ignorance. If you\\'re feeling cocky, it\\'s because there\\'s something you don\\'t know. I like good strong words that mean somethingâ€¦ A book lying idle on a shelf is wasted ammunition. The purpose of life is to live it, to taste experience to the utmost, to reach out eagerly and without fear for newer and richer experience. Dreams do come true, if only we wish hard enough. You can have anything in life if you will sacrifice everything else for it. Nothing in the world is ever completely wrong. Even a stopped clock is right twice a day. What\\'s the good of living if you don\\'t try a few things? When you find your path, you must not be afraid. You need to have sufficient courage to make mistakes. Disappointment, defeat, and despair are the tools God uses to show us the way. The happiness of your life depends upon the quality of your thoughts. All alone! Whether you like it or not, alone is something you\\'ll be quite a lot! Do not fall in love with people like me. I will take you to museums, and parks, and monuments, and kiss you in every beautiful place, so that you can never go back to them without tasting me like blood in your mouth.I will destroy you in the most beautiful way possible. And when I leave you will finally understand, why storms are named after people. Yes, I was infatuated with you: I am still. No one has ever heightened such a keen capacity of physical sensation in me. I cut you out because I couldn\\'t stand being a passing fancy. Before I give my body, I must give my thoughts, my mind, my dreams. And you weren\\'t having any of those. There is more to sex appeal than just measurements. I don\\'t need a bedroom to prove my womanliness. I can convey just as much sex appeal, picking apples off a tree or standing in the rain. I wonder if the snow loves the trees and fields, that it kisses them so gently? And then it covers them up snug, you know, with a white quilt; and perhaps it says, \"Go to sleep, darlings, till the summer comes again. Learn to value yourself, which means: fight for your happiness. In the darkness, two shadows, reaching through the hopeless, heavy dusk. Their hands meet, and light spills in a flood like a hundred golden urns pouring out of the sun. The ships hung in the sky in much the same way that bricks don\\'t. Never underestimate the power of stupid people in large groups. Everyone must leave something behind when he dies, my grandfather said. A child or a book or a painting or a house or a wall built or a pair of shoes made. Or a garden planted. Something your hand touched some way so your soul has somewhere to go when you die, and when people look at that tree or that flower you planted, you\\'re there. It doesn\\'t matter what you do, he said, so long as you change something from the way it was before you touched it into something that\\'s like you after you take your hands away. The difference between the man who just cuts lawns and a real gardener is in the touching, he said. The lawn-cutter might just as well not have been there at all; the gardener will be there a lifetime. Lack of direction, not lack of time, is the problem. We all have twenty-four hour days. I have learned now that while those who speak about one\\'s miseries usually hurt, those who keep silence hurt more. Courage is resistance to fear, mastery of fear - not absence of fear. I want to grow old without facelifts. I want to have the courage to be loyal to the face I have made. Change will not come if we wait for some other person, or if we wait for some other time. We are the ones we\\'ve been waiting for. We are the change that we seek. Honestly, if you were any slower, youâ€™d be going backward. The saddest people I\\'ve ever met in life are the ones who don\\'t care deeply about anything at all. Passion and satisfaction go hand in hand, and without them, any happiness is only temporary, because there\\'s nothing to make it last. Quotation is a serviceable substitute for wit. If people refuse to look at you in a new light and they can only see you for what you were, only see you for the mistakes you\\'ve made, if they don\\'t realize that you are not your mistakes, then they have to go. Believe nothing you hear, and only one half that you see. If you want to find out what a man is to the bottom, give him power. Any man can stand adversity â€ only a great man can stand prosperity. It is the glory of Abraham Lincoln that he never abused power only on the side of mercy Dreams like a podcast,Downloading truth in my ears.They tell me cool stuff.\"\"Apollo?\" I guess, because I figured nobody else could make a haiku that bad.He put his finger to his lips. \"I\\'m incognito. Call me Fred.\"\"A god named Fred? Sonnet XVIII do not love you as if you were salt-rose, or topaz,or the arrow of carnations the fire shoots off.I love you as certain dark things are to be loved,in secret, between the shadow and the soul.I love you as the plant that never bloomsbut carries in itself the light of hidden flowers;thanks to your love a certain solid fragrance,risen from the earth, lives darkly in my body.I love you without knowing how, or when, or from where.I love you straightforwardly, without complexities or pride;so I love you because I know no other way than this: where I does not exist, nor you,so close that your hand on my chest is my hand,so close that your eyes close as I fall asleep.  Atheism turns out to be too simple. If the whole universe has no meaning, we should never have found out that it has no meaning... If you end up with a boring miserable life because you listened to your mom, your dad, your teacher, your priest, or some guy on television telling you how to do your shit, then you deserve it. If conversation was the lyrics, laughter was the music, making time spent together a melody that could be replayed over and over without getting stale. When I get lonely these days, I think: So BE lonely, Liz. Learn your way around loneliness. Make a map of it. Sit with it, for once in your life. Welcome to the human experience. But never again use another person\\'s body or emotions as a scratching post for your own unfulfilled yearnings. Jesper knocked his head against the hull and cast his eyes heavenward. â€œFine. But if Pekka Rollins kills us all, Iâ€™m going to get Wylanâ€™s ghost to teach my ghost how to play the flute just so that I can annoy the hell out of your ghost.â€�Brekkerâ€™s lips quirked. â€œIâ€™ll just hire Matthiasâ€™ ghost to kick your ghostâ€™s ass.â€�â€œMy ghost wonâ€™t associate with your ghost,â€� Matthias said primly, and then wondered if the sea air was rotting his brain. Have a heart that never hardens, and a temper that never tires, and a touch that never hurts. Are you implying that shreds of my reputation remain intact?\" Will demanded with mock horror. \"Clearly I have been doing something wrong. Or not something wrong, as the case may be.\" He banged on the side of the carriage. \"Thomas! We must away at once to the nearest brothel. I seek scandal and low companionship. Here is a lesson in creative writing. First rule: Do not use semicolons. They are transvestite hermaphrodites representing absolutely nothing. All they do is show you\\'ve been to college. No persons are more frequently wrong, than those who will not admit they are wrong. Only the dead have seen the end of war. A snowball in the face is surely the perfect beginning to a lasting friendship. If neurotic is wanting two mutually exclusive things at one and the same time, then I\\'m neurotic as hell. I\\'ll be flying back and forth between one mutually exclusive thing and another for the rest of my days. I\\'m oxygen and he\\'s dying to breathe. The world is full of magic things, patiently waiting for our senses to grow sharper. Never interrupt your enemy when he is making a mistake. I fell in love with him. But I don\\'t just stay with him by default as if there\\'s no one else available to me. I stay with him because I choose to, every day that I wake up, every day that we fight or lie to each other or disappoint each other. I choose him over and over again, and he chooses me. God can\\'t give us peace and happiness apart from Himself because there is no such thing. Men are afraid that women will laugh at them. Women are afraid that men will kill them. Go on with what your heart tells you, or you will lose all. Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak! Let our scars fall in love. If you would tell me the heart of a man, tell me not what he reads, but what he rereads. Expose yourself to your deepest fear; after that, fear has no power, and the fear of freedom shrinks and vanishes. You are free. If there\\'s a single lesson that life teaches us, it\\'s that wishing doesn\\'t make it so. A lot of you cared, just not enough. Donâ€™t try to make life a mathematics problem with yourself in the center and everything coming out equal. When youâ€™re good, bad things can still happen. And if youâ€™re bad, you can still be lucky. If you want to know what God thinks of money, just look at the people he gave it to. I am not afraid of storms, for I am learning how to sail my ship. Only those who will risk going too far can possibly find out how far one can go. Fill your paper with the breathings of your heart. Open your heart. Someone will come. Someone will come for you. But first you must open your heart. Our mothers always remain the strangest, craziest people we\\'ve ever met. Illegal aliens have always been a problem in the United States. Ask any Indian. From there to here, from here to there, funny things are everywhere! The glory of friendship is not the outstretched hand, not the kindly smile, nor the joy of companionship; it is the spiritual inspiration that comes to one when you discover that someone else believes in you and is willing to trust you with a friendship. Books are not made to be believed, but to be subjected to inquiry. When we consider a book, we mustn\\'t ask ourselves what it says but what it means... She refused to be bored chiefly because she wasn\\'t boring. Kindness is a language which the deaf can hear and the blind can see. Did you ever think that in a past life Alec was an old woman with ninety cats who was always yelling at the neighborhood kids to get off her lawn? Because I do, It is a good rule after reading a new book, never to allow yourself another new one till you have read an old one in between. My library is an archive of longings. Older men declare war. But it is youth that must fight and die. Just because you\\'re paranoid doesn\\'t mean they aren\\'t after you. I am glad you are here with me. Here at the end of all things, Sam. Families are messy. Immortal families are eternally messy. Sometimes the best we can do is to remind each other that we\\'re related for better or for worse...and try to keep the maiming and killing to a minimum. Because you can\\'t argue with all the fools in the world. It\\'s easier to let them have their way, then trick them when they\\'re not paying attention. Lolita, light of my life, fire of my loins. My sin, my soul. Lo-lee-ta: the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate to tap, at three, on the teeth. Lo. Lee. Ta. She was Lo, plain Lo, in the morning, standing four feet ten in one sock. She was Lola in slacks. She was Dolly at school. She was Dolores on the dotted line. But in my arms she was always Lolita. Did she have a precursor? She did, indeed she did. In point of fact, there might have been no Lolita at all had I not loved, one summer, an initial girl-child. In a princedom by the sea. Oh when? About as many years before Lolita was born as my age was that summer. You can always count on a murderer for a fancy prose style. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, exhibit number one is what the seraphs, the misinformed, simple, noble-winged seraphs, envied. Look at this tangle of thorns. Happiness is holding someone in your arms and knowing you hold the whole world. Behind every exquisite thing that existed, there was something tragic. Don\\'t compromise yourself - you\\'re all you have. I know I am but summer to your heart, and not the full four seasons of the year. DON\\'T THINK OF IT AS DYING, said Death. JUST THINK OF IT AS LEAVING EARLY TO AVOID THE RUSH. silence is the language of god, all else is poor translation. If you think you are too small to make a difference, try sleeping with a mosquito. I drink to make other people more interesting. Scared is what you\\'re feeling. Brave is what you\\'re doing. There is only one sin. and that is theft... when you tell a lie, you steal someones right to the truth. It was a mistake,\" you said. But the cruel thing was, it felt like the mistake was mine, for trusting you. I thought I\\'d lie on the floor and writhe in pain for a while,\" he grunted, \"It relaxes me.\"\"It does? Oh - you\\'re being sarcastic. That\\'s a good sign probably. Ah, my daughter,Êº he said. ÊºEighteen, and already youÊ¹ve been accused of murder, aided felons, and acquired a death count higher than most guardians will ever see.Êº He paused. ÊºI couldnÊ¹t be prouder. What she was finding also was how one book led to another, doors kept opening wherever she turned and the days weren\\'t long enough for the reading she wanted to do. One of the advantages of being disorganized is that one is always having surprising discoveries. A house without books is like a room without windows. Remember, remember, this is now, and now, and now. Live it, feel it, cling to it. I want to become acutely aware of all Iâ€™ve taken for granted. The more you know who you are, and what you want, the less you let things upset you. We can know only that we know nothing. And that is the highest degree of human wisdom. Do your little bit of good where you are; it\\'s those little bits of good put together that overwhelm the world. Owners of dogs will have noticed that, if you provide them with food and water and shelter and affection, they will think you are god. Whereas owners of cats are compelled to realize that, if you provide them with food and water and shelter and affection, they draw the conclusion that they are gods. It\\'s the questions we can\\'t answer that teach us the most. They teach us how to think. If you give a man an answer, all he gains is a little fact. But give him a question and he\\'ll look for his own answers. Don\\'t spend time beating on a wall, hoping to transform it into a door.  Talk sense to a fool and he calls you foolish. It\\'s not gray,\" Clary felt compelled to point out. \"It\\'s green.\"\"If there was such a thing as terminal literalism, you\\'d have died in childhood,\" said Jace.

What if Christmas, he thought, doesn\\'t come from a store. What if Christmas...perhaps...means a little bit more! It is a curious thing, Harry, but perhaps those who are best suited to power are those who have never sought it. Those who, like you, have leadership thrust upon them, and take up the mantle because they must, and find to their own surprise that they wear it well. I don\\'t want tea,\" said Clary, with muffled force. \"I want to find my mother. And then I want to find out who took her in the first place, and I want to kill them.\"\"Unfortunately,\" said Hodge, \"we\\'re all out of bitter revenge at the moment, so it\\'s either tea or nothing. Reputation is what other people know about you. Honor is what you know about yourself. When did we see each other face-to-face? Not until you saw into my cracks and I saw into yours. Before that, we were just looking at ideas of each other, like looking at your window shade but never seeing inside. But once the vessel cracks, the light can get in. The light can get out. A word after a word after a word is power. Give her hell from us, Peeves. You\\'re just worried they\\'ll hire a male instructor and he\\'ll be hotter than you.\" Jace\\'s eyebrows went up. \"Hotter than me?\" \"It could happen,\" Clary said, \"You know, theoretically.\"\"Theoretically the planet could suddenly crack in half, leaving me on one side and you on the other, forever and tragically parted, but I\\'m not worried about that either. Some things,\" Jace said, with his customary crooked smile, \"are just too unlikely to dwell upon. That which can be asserted without evidence, can be dismissed without evidence. Try a little harder to be a little better. Cry. Forgive. Learn. Move on. Let your tears water the seeds of your future happiness. You could have fooled me. Everytime I called you, Luke said you were sick. I figured you were avoiding me. Again.\"\"I wasn\\'t. I did want to talk to you. I\\'ve been thinking about you all the time.\"\"I\\'ve been thinking about you, too.\"\"I really was sick. I swear. I almost died back there on the ship, you know.\"\"I know. Everytime you almost die, I almost die myself. Let me give you a piece of advice. The handsome young fellow who\\'s trying to rescue you from a hideous fate is never wrong. Not even if he says the sky is purple and made of hedgehogs. There is something delicious about writing the first words of a story. You never quite know where they\\'ll take you. Every book, every volume you see here, has a soul. The soul of the person who wrote it and of those who read it and lived and dreamed with it. Every time a book changes hands, every time someone runs his eyes down its pages, its spirit grows and strengthens. Who, being loved, is poor? There is only one page left to write on. I will fill it with words of only one syllable. I love. I have loved. I will love. The creatures outside looked from pig to man, and from man to pig, and from pig to man again; but already it was impossible to say which was which. She had always wanted words, she loved them; grew up on them. Words gave her clarity, brought reason, shape. Even strength must bow to wisdom sometimes. Time doesnâ€™t heal emotional pain, you need to learn how to let go. I\\'m on Aslan\\'s side even if there isn\\'t any Aslan to lead it. I\\'m going to live as like a Narnian as I can even if there isn\\'t any Narnia. If A is a success in life, then A equals x plus y plus z. Work is x; y is play; and z is keeping your mouth shut The mind once enlightened cannot again become dark. Nothing in the world is more dangerous than sincere ignorance and conscientious stupidity. Whenever you read a cancer booklet or website or whatever, they always list depression among the side effects of cancer. But, in fact, depression is not a side effect of cancer. Depression is a side effect of dying. Those who know do not speak. Those who speak do not know. You\\'d think people had better things to gossip about,\" said Ginny as she sat on the common room floor, leaning against Harryâ€™s legs and reading the Daily Prophet. \"Three Dementor attacks in a week, and all Romilda Vane does is ask me if itâ€™s true youâ€™ve got a Hippogriff tattooed across your chest.\"Ron and Hermione both roared with laughter. Harry ignored them.What did you tell her?\"I told her it\\'s a Hungarian Horntail,\" said Ginny, turning a page of the newspaper idly. \"Much more macho.\"Thanks,\" said Harry, grinning. \"And what did you tell her Ronâ€™s got?\"A Pygmy Puff, but I didnâ€™t say where. Everything we hear is an opinion, not a fact. Everything we see is a perspective, not the truth. I wrote the story myself. It\\'s about a girl who lost her reputation and never missed it. Love can change a person the way a parent can change a baby- awkwardly, and often with a great deal of mess. A childhood without books â€ that would be no childhood. That would be like being shut out from the enchanted place where you can go and find the rarest kind of joy. Reading brings us unknown friends If you want to keep a secret, you must also hide it from yourself. You are not your job, you\\'re not how much money you have in the bank. You are not the car you drive. You\\'re not the contents of your wallet. You are not your fucking khakis. You are all singing, all dancing crap of the world. You\\'re an idiot.\"\"I\\'ve never claimed to be otherwise. When people talk, listen completely. Most people never listen. The important thing to you is not how many years in your life, but how much life in your years! This is the way the world endsNot with a bang but a whimper. My soul will find yours. I think we ought to read only the kind of books that wound or stab us. If the book we\\'re reading doesn\\'t wake us up with a blow to the head, what are we reading for? So that it will make us happy, as you write? Good Lord, we would be happy precisely if we had no books, and the kind of books that make us happy are the kind we could write ourselves if we had to. But we need books that affect us like a disaster, that grieve us deeply, like the death of someone we loved more than ourselves, like being banished into forests far from everyone, like a suicide. A book must be the axe for the frozen sea within us. That is my belief. The greatest enemy of knowledge is not ignorance, it is the illusion of knowledge. All parents damage their children. It cannot be helped. Youth, like pristine glass, absorbs the prints of its handlers. Some parents smudge, others crack, a few shatter childhoods completely into jagged little pieces, beyond repair. Did you know that \\'I told you so\\' has a brother,Jacob?\" she asked cutting me off. \"His name is \\'Shut the hell up\\'. When we least expect it, life sets us a challenge to test our courage and willingness to change; at such a moment, there is no point in pretending that nothing has happened or in saying that we are not yet ready. The challenge will not wait. Life does not look back. A week is more than enough time for us to decide whether or not to accept our destiny. May the odds be ever in your favor! How nice -- to feel nothing, and still get full credit for being alive. I always channel my emotions into my work. That way, I don\\'t hurt anyone but myself. In time, the hurt began to fade and it was easier to just let it go. At least I thought it was. But in every boy I met in the next few years, I found myself looking for you, and when the feelings got too strong, I\\'d write you another letter. But I never sent them for fear of what I might find. By then, you\\'d gone on with your life and I didn\\'t want to think about you loving someone else. I wanted to remember us like we were that summer. I didn\\'t ever want to lose that. Really, the combination of the scabs and the ointment looks hideous. I can\\'t help enjoying his distress.\"Poor Finnick. Is this the first time in your life you haven\\'t looked pretty?\" I say.\"It must be. The sensation\\'s completely new. How have you managed it all these years?\" he asks.\"Just avoid mirrors. You\\'ll forget about it,\" I say.\"Not if I keep looking at you,\" he says. I fell in love with you, smartass, because you were one of usâ€because you werenâ€™t afraid of me, and you decided to end your spectacular victory by throwing that piece of bone at Amarantha like a javelin. I felt Cassianâ€™s spirit beside me in that moment, and could have sworn I heard him say, â€˜If you donâ€™t marry her, you stupid prick, I will. As it has been said:Love and a coughcannot be concealed.Even a small cough.Even a small love. By the pricking of my thumbs, Something wicked this way comes. Ask not what you can do for your country. Ask whatâ€™s for lunch. The pleasure of remembering had been taken from me, because there was no longer anyone to remember with. It felt like losing your co-rememberer meant losing the memory itself, as if the things we\\'d done were less real and important than they had been hours before. No one has ever become poor by giving. Of all the words of mice and men, the saddest are, \"It might have been. Time is the longest distance between two places. Lost opportunities, lost possibilities, feelings we can never get back. That\\'s part of what it means to be alive. But inside our heads - at least that\\'s where I imagine it - there\\'s a little room where we store those memories. A room like the stacks in this library. And to understand the workings of our own heart we have to keep on making new reference cards. We have to dust things off every once in awhile, let in fresh air, change the water in the flower vases. In other words, you\\'ll live forever in your own private library. Hope can be a powerful force. Maybe there\\'s no actual magic in it, but when you know what you hope for most and hold it like a light within you, you can make things happen, almost like magic. Tomorrow may be hell, but today was a good writing day, and on the good writing days nothing else matters. Forgive, O Lord, my little jokes on TheeAnd I\\'ll forgive Thy great big one on me. My concern is not whether God is on our side; my greatest concern is to be on God\\'s side, for God is always right. I love books, by the way, way more than movies. Movies tell you what to think. A good book lets you choose a few thoughts for yourself. Movies show you the pink house. A good book tells you there\\'s a pink house and lets you paint some of the finishing touches, maybe choose the roof style,park your own car out front. My imagination has always topped anything a movie could come up with. Case in point, those darned Harry Potter movies. That was so not what that part-Veela-chick, Fleur Delacour, looked like. Sometimes beautiful things come into our lives out of nowhere. We can\\'t always understand them, but we have to trust in them. I know you want to question everything, but sometimes it pays to just have a little faith. Remember, darkness does not always equate to evil, just as light does not always bring good. A diary with no drawings of me in it? Where are the torrid fantasies? The romance covers? Do not be afraid; our fateCannot be taken from us; it is a gift. He accused me of being Dumbledore\\'s man through and through.\"\"How very rude of him.\"\"I told him I was.\"Dumbledore opened his mouth to speak and then closed it again. Fawkes the phoenix let out a low, soft, musical cry. To Harry\\'s intense embarrassment, he suddenly realized that Dumbledore\\'s bright blue eyes looked rather watery, and stared hastily at his own knee. When Dumbledore spoke, however, his voice was quite steady. \"I am very touched, Harry. I meant what I said and I said what I meant. An elephant\\'s faithful one-hundred percent! Faith is not the belief that God will do what you want. It is the belief that God will do what is right. To shine your brightest light is to be who you truly are. Sometimes you read a book so special that you want to carry it around with you for months after you\\'ve finished just to stay near it. That\\'s what careless words do. They make people love you a little less. Animals are my friends...and I don\\'t eat my friends. In individuals, insanity is rare; but in groups, parties, nations and epochs, it is the rule. What day is it?â€� asked Pooh. â€œItâ€™s today,â€� squeaked Piglet.â€œMy favorite day,â€� said Pooh. Crying is for plain women. Pretty women go shopping. What do we live for, if it is not to make life less difficult for each other? I do not think, sir, you have any right to command me, merely because you are older than I, or because you have seen more of the world than I have; your claim to superiority depends on the use you have made of your time and experience. Ah, music,\" he said, wiping his eyes. \"A magic beyond all we do here! Sometimes, when I have to do something I don\\'t want to do, I pretend I\\'m a character from a book. It\\'s easier to know what they would do. Art washes away from the soul the dust of everyday life. When I was about eight, I decided that the most wonderful thing, next to a human being, was a book. Knowing too much of your future is never a good thing. You must not lose faith in humanity. Humanity is like an ocean; if a few drops of the ocean are dirty, the ocean does not become dirty. There are so many ways to be brave in this world. Sometimes bravery involves laying down your life for something bigger than yourself, or for someone else. Sometimes it involves giving up everything you have ever known, or everyone you have ever loved, for the sake of something greater.But sometimes it doesn\\'t.Sometimes it is nothing more than gritting your teeth through pain, and the work of every day, the slow walk toward a better life. That is the sort of bravery I must have now. Be thankful for everything that happens in your life; itâ€™s all an experience. The reason it hurts so much to separate is because our souls are connected. Maybe they always have been and will be. Maybe we\\'ve lived a thousand lives before this one and in each of them we\\'ve found each other. And maybe each time, we\\'ve been forced apart for the same reasons. That means that this goodbye is both a goodbye for the past ten thousand years and a prelude to what will come. I\\'m going to wake Peeta,\" I say.\"No, wait,\" says Finnick. \"Let\\'s do it together. Put our faces right in front of his.\"Well, there\\'s so little opportunity for fun left in my life, I agree. We position ourselves on either side of Peeta, lean over until our faces are inches frim his nose, and give him a shake. \"Peeta. Peeta, wake up,\" I say in a soft, singsong voice.His eyelids flutter open and then he jumps like we\\'ve stabbed him. \"Aa!\"Finnick and I fall back in the sand, laughing our heads off. Every time we try to stop, we look at Peeta\\'s attempt to maintain a disdainful expression and it sets us off again. The moon is a loyal companion.It never leaves. Itâ€™s always there, watching, steadfast, knowing us in our light and dark moments, changing forever just as we do. Every day itâ€™s a different version of itself. Sometimes weak and wan, sometimes strong and full of light. The moon understands what it means to be human.Uncertain. Alone. Cratered by imperfections. They say time heals all wounds, but that presumes the source of the grief is finite I have the simplest tastes. I am always satisfied with the best. If you know someone whoâ€™s depressed, please resolve never to ask them why. Depression isnâ€™t a straightforward response to a bad situation; depression just is, like the weather.Try to understand the blackness, lethargy, hopelessness, and loneliness theyâ€™re going through. Be there for them when they come through the other side. Itâ€™s hard to be a friend to someone whoâ€™s depressed, but it is one of the kindest, noblest, and best things you will ever do. Friendship marks a life even more deeply than love. Love risks degenerating into obsession, friendship is never anything but sharing. Peeta, how come I never know when you\\'re having a nightmare?â€� I say.â€œI don\\'t know. I don\\'t think I cry out or thrash around or anything. I just come to, paralyzed with terror,â€� he says.â€œYou should wake me,â€� I say, thinking about how I can interrupt his sleep two or three times on a bad night. About how long it can take to calm me down.â€œIt\\'s not necessary. My nightmares are usually about losing you,â€� he says. â€œI\\'m okay once I realize you\\'re here. I\\'m a success today because I had a friend who believed in me and I didn\\'t have the heart to let him down. You may encounter many defeats, but you must not be defeated. In fact, it may be necessary to encounter the defeats, so you can know who you are, what you can rise from, how you can still come out of it. Sell your cleverness and buy bewilderment. The scar had not pained Harry for nineteen years. All was well. Have you really read all those books in your room?â€�Alaska laughing- â€œOh God no. Iâ€™ve maybe read a third of â€˜em. But Iâ€™m going to read them all. I call it my Lifeâ€™s Library. Every summer since I was little, Iâ€™ve gone to garage sales and bought all the books that looked interesting. So I always have something to read. Strange as it may seem, I still hope for the best, even though the best, like an interesting piece of mail, so rarely arrives, and even when it does it can be lost so easily. Ever has it been that love knows not its own depth until the hour of separation. He was gone, and I did not have time to tell him what I had just now realized: that I forgave him, and that she forgave us, and that we had to forgive to survive in the labyrinth. There were so many of us who would have to live with things done and things left undone that day. Things that did not go right, things that seemed okay at the time because we could not see the future. If only we could see the endless string of consequences that result from our smallest actions. But we canâ€™t know better until knowing better is useless. And as I walked back to give Takumiâ€™s note to the Colonel, I saw that I would never know. I would never know her well enough to know her thoughts in those last minutes, would never know if she left us on purpose. But the not-knowing would not keep me from caring, and I would always love Alaska Young, my crooked neighbor, with all my crooked heart. Come sleep with me: We won\\'t make Love, Love will make us. The heart has its reasons which reason knows not. The longer and more carefully we look at a funny story, the sadder it becomes. Courage is found in unlikely places. If you look the right way, you can see that the whole world is a garden. Tears are words that need to be written. Though my soul may set in darkness, it will rise in perfect light; I have loved the stars too fondly to be fearful of the night. Where you used to be, there is a hole in the world, which I find myself constantly walking around in the daytime, and falling in at night. I miss you like hell. I bet you could sometimes find all the mysteries of the universe in someone\\'s hand. Adults are just obsolete children and the hell with them. It is easy to love people in memory; the hard thing is to love them when they are there in front of you. I must learn to be content with being happier than I deserve. Tis the privilege of friendship to talk nonsense, and to have her nonsense respected. The spell. Victor said you had to want me... to care about me... for it to work.\" When he didn\\'t say anything, I tried to grip his shirt, but my fingers were too weak. \"Did you? Did you want me?\"His words came out thickly. \"Yes, Roza. I did want you. I still do. I wish... we could be together.\"\"Then why did you lie to me?\"We reached the clinic, and he managed to open the door while still holding me. As soon as he stepped inside, he began yelling for help. \"Why did you lie?\" I murmured again.Still holding me in his arms, he looked down at me. I could hear voices and footsteps getting closer.\"Because we can\\'t be together.\"\"Because of the age thing, right?\" I asked. \"Because you\\'re my mentor?\"His fingertip gently wiped away a tear that had escaped down my cheek. \"That\\'s part of it,\" he said. \"But also... well, you and I will both be Lissa\\'s gaurdians someday. I need to protect her at all cost. If a pack of Strogoi come, I need to throw my body between them and her.\"I know that. Of course that\\'s what you have to do.\" The black sparkles were dancing in front of my eyes again. I was fading out.\"No. If I let myself love you, I won\\'t throw myself in front of her. I\\'ll throw myself in front of you. People come, people go â€ theyâ€™ll drift in and out of your life, almost like characters in a favorite book. When you finally close the cover, the characters have told their story and you start up again with another book, complete with new characters and adventures. Then you find yourself focusing on the new ones, not the ones from the past. The nitrogen in our DNA, the calcium in our teeth, the iron in our blood, the carbon in our apple pies were made in the interiors of collapsing stars. We are made of starstuff. I myself have never been able to find out precisely what feminism is: I only know that people call me a feminist whenever I express sentiments that differentiate me from a doormat. Always go to other people\\'s funerals, otherwise they won\\'t come to yours. It\\'s no good pretending that any relationship has a future if your record collections disagree violently or if your favorite films wouldn\\'t even speak to each other if they met at a party. We are addicted to our thoughts. We cannot change anything if we cannot change our thinking. Happiness can be found, even in the darkest of times, if one only remembers to turn on the light. I read once that the ancient Egyptians had fifty words for sand & the Eskimos had a hundred words for snow. I wish I had a thousand words for love, but all that comes to mind is the way you move against me while you sleep & there are no words for that. Pretty women wonder where my secret lies.I\\'m not cute or built to suit a fashion model\\'s sizeBut when I start to tell them,They think I\\'m telling lies.I say,It\\'s in the reach of my armsThe span of my hips,The stride of my step,The curl of my lips.I\\'m a womanPhenomenally.Phenomenal woman,That\\'s me. You know how they say you only hurt the ones you love? Well, it works both ways. Even in half demon hunter clothes, Clary thought, he looked like the kind of boy who\\'d come over your house to pick you up for a date and be polite to your parents and nice to your pets.Jace on the other hand, looked like the kind of boy who\\'d come over your house and burn it down just for kicks. It\\'s not always necessary to be strong, but to feel strong. What do you want?\"\"Just coffee. Black - like my soul. If we couldn\\'t laugh we would all go insane. Sometimes you have to lose all you have to find out who you truly are. I cannot go to school today\"Said little Peggy Ann McKay.\"I have the measles and the mumps,A gash, a rash and purple bumps.My mouth is wet, my throat is dry.I\\'m going blind in my right eye.My tonsils are as big as rocks,I\\'ve counted sixteen chicken pox.And there\\'s one more - that\\'s seventeen,And don\\'t you think my face looks green?My leg is cut, my eyes are blue,It might be the instamatic flu.I cough and sneeze and gasp and choke,I\\'m sure that my left leg is broke.My hip hurts when I move my chin,My belly button\\'s caving in.My back is wrenched, my ankle\\'s sprained,My \\'pendix pains each time it rains.My toes are cold, my toes are numb,I have a sliver in my thumb.My neck is stiff, my voice is weak,I hardly whisper when I speak.My tongue is filling up my mouth,I think my hair is falling out.My elbow\\'s bent, my spine ain\\'t straight,My temperature is one-o-eight.My brain is shrunk, I cannot hear,There\\'s a hole inside my ear.I have a hangnail, and my heart is ...What? What\\'s that? What\\'s that you say?You say today is .............. Saturday?G\\'bye, I\\'m going out to play! The trouble is not that I am single and likely to stay single, but that I am lonely and likely to stay lonely. We are the music makers, and we are the dreamers of dreams. I like too many things and get all confused and hung-up running from one falling star to another till i drop. This is the night, what it does to you. I had nothing to offer anybody except my own confusion. Is it possible for home to be a person and not a place? Don\\'t let the bastards grind you down. Lost love is still love. It takes a different form, that\\'s all. You can\\'t see their smile or bring them food or tousle their hair or move them around a dance floor. But when those senses weaken another heightens. Memory. Memory becomes your partner. You nurture it. You hold it. You dance with it. A word to the wise ain\\'t necessary, it\\'s the stupid ones who need advice. The trouble is if you donâ€™t spend your life yourself, other people spend it for you. Time was passing like a hand waving from a train I wanted to be on. I hope you never have to think about anything as much as I think about you. I travel not to go anywhere, but to go. I travel for travel\\'s sake. The great affair is to move. I don\\'t think of all the misery, but of the beauty that still remains. I like flaws. I think they make things interesting. Children begin by loving their parents; as they grow older they judge them; sometimes they forgive them. If you don\\'t know history, then you don\\'t know anything. You are a leaf that doesn\\'t know it is part of a tree.  There must be those among whom we can sit down and weep and still be counted as warriors. A wonderful fact to reflect upon, that every human creature is constituted to be that profound secret and mystery to every other. It is good to have an end to journey toward; but it is the journey that matters, in the end. I must have loved you a lot. Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.Tis some visitor,\" I muttered, \"tapping at my chamber door â€ Only this, and nothing more.\"Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December,And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.Eagerly I wished the morrow; â€ vainly I had sought to borrowFrom my books surcease of sorrow â€ sorrow for the lost Lenore â€For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore â€ Nameless here for evermore.And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtainThrilled me â€ filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating,Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door â€Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door; â€ This it is, and nothing more.\"Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,Sir,\" said I, \"or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,That I scarce was sure I heard you\"â€ here I opened wide the door; â€ Darkness there, and nothing more.Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortals ever dared to dream before;But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, \"Lenore?\"This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, \"Lenore!\" â€ Merely this, and nothing more.Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.Surely,\" said I, \"surely that is something at my window lattice:Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore â€Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore; â€ \\'Tis the wind and nothing more.\"Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,In there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore;Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door â€Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door â€ Perched, and sat, and nothing more.Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore.Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,\" I said, \"art sure no craven,Ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the Nightly shore â€Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night\\'s Plutonian shore!\" Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"Much I marveled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,Though its answer little meaningâ€ little relevancy bore;For we cannot help agreeing that no living human beingEver yet was blest with seeing bird above his chamber door â€Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door, With such name as \"Nevermore. You must write every single day of your life... You must lurk in libraries and climb the stacks like ladders to sniff books like perfumes and wear books like hats upon your crazy heads... may you be in love every day for the next 20,000 days. And out of that love, remake a world. It\\'s not the size of the dog in the fight, it\\'s the size of the fight in the dog. When you are content to be simply yourself and don\\'t compare or compete, everyone will respect you. One wordFrees us of all the weight and pain of life:That word is love. Thinking something does not make it true. Wanting something does not make it real. You know, Hobbes, some days even my lucky rocket ship underpants don\\'t help. We\\'re staying together,\" he promised. \"You\\'re not getting away from me. Never again. True love is usually the most inconvenient kind. When I was your age, television was called books. The greatness of a man is not in how much wealth he acquires, but in his integrity and his ability to affect those around him positively. From childhood\\'s hour I have not been. As others were, I have not seen. As others saw, I could not awaken. My heart to joy at the same tone. And all I loved, I loved alone. There are two means of refuge from the misery of life â€ music and cats. It gives me strength to have somebody to fight for; I can never fight for myself, but, for others, I can kill. When one tugs at a single thing in nature, he finds it attached to the rest of the world. Ginny!\" said Mr. Weasley, flabbergasted. \"Haven\\'t I taught you anything? What have I always told you? Never trust anything that can think for itself if you can\\'t see where it keeps its brain? The love of learning, the sequestered nooks,And all the sweet serenity of books I am always saying \"Glad to\\'ve met you\" to somebody I\\'m not at all glad I met. If you want to stay alive, you have to say that stuff, though. Children have never been very good at listening to their elders, but they have never failed to imitate them. [D]on\\'t ever apologise to an author for buying something in paperback, or taking it out from a library (that\\'s what they\\'re there for. Use your library). Don\\'t apologise to this author for buying books second hand, or getting them from bookcrossing or borrowing a friend\\'s copy. What\\'s important to me is that people read the books and enjoy them, and that, at some point in there, the book was bought by someone. And that people who like things, tell other people. The most important thing is that people read... The brick walls are there for a reason. The brick walls are not there to keep us out. The brick walls are there to give us a chance to show how badly we want something. Because the brick walls are there to stop the people who donâ€™t want it badly enough. Theyâ€™re there to stop the other people. You can make anything by writing. There are only the pursued, the pursuing, the busy and the tired. You are not entitled to your opinion. You are entitled to your informed opinion. No one is entitled to be ignorant. And all the books you\\'ve read have been read by other people. And all the songs you\\'ve loved have been heard by other people. And that girl that\\'s pretty to you is pretty to other people. and that if you looked at these facts when you were happy, you would feel great because you are describing \\'unity. Trust your heart if the seas catch fire, live by love though the stars walk backward. Friendship- my definition- is built on two things. Respect and trust. Both elements have to be there. And it has to be mutual. You can have respect for someone, but if you don\\'t have trust, the friendship will crumble. When everything goes to hell, the people who stand by you without flinching -- they are your family.  Black holes are where God divided by zero. Life is not a matter of holding good cards, but of playing a poor hand well. Jace shook his blond head in exasperation. \"You had to make a crazy jail friend, didn\\'t you? You couldn\\'t just count ceiling tiles or tame a pet mouse like normal prisoners do? If Iâ€™m honest I have to tell you I still read fairy-tales and I like them best of all. If you have a sister and she dies, do you stop saying you have one? Or are you always a sister, even when the other half of the equation is gone? Reading is the sole means by which we slip, involuntarily, often helplessly, into another\\'s skin, another\\'s voice, another\\'s soul. Therefore, dear Sir, love your solitude and try to sing out with the pain it causes you. For those who are near you are far away... and this shows that the space around you is beginning to grow vast.... be happy about your growth, in which of course you can\\'t take anyone with you, and be gentle with those who stay behind; be confident and calm in front of them and don\\'t torment them with your doubts and don\\'t frighten them with your faith or joy, which they wouldn\\'t be able to comprehend. Seek out some simple and true feeling of what you have in common with them, which doesn\\'t necessarily have to alter when you yourself change again and again; when you see them, love life in a form that is not your own and be indulgent toward those who are growing old, who are afraid of the aloneness that you trust.... and don\\'t expect any understanding; but believe in a love that is being stored up for you like an inheritance, and have faith that in this love there is a strength and a blessing so large that you can travel as far as you wish without having to step outside it. Being a writer is a very peculiar sort of a job: it\\'s always you versus a blank sheet of paper (or a blank screen) and quite often the blank piece of paper wins. No matter how careful you are, there\\'s going to be the sense you missed something, the collapsed feeling under your skin that you didn\\'t experience it all. There\\'s that fallen heart feeling that you rushed right through the moments where you should\\'ve been paying attention.Well, get used to that feeling. That\\'s how your whole life will feel some day.This is all practice. Behind every beautiful thing, there\\'s some kind of pain. What happened down in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a complete secret, so, naturally the whole school knows. Writing is like sex. First you do it for love, then you do it for your friends, and then you do it for money. My name is Celaena Sardothien. But it makes no difference if my name\\'s Celaena or Lillian or Bitch, because I\\'d still beat you, no matter what you call me. When I saw you I fell in love, and you smiled because you knew. Books have to be heavy because the whole world\\'s inside them. please believe that things are good with me, and even when they\\'re not, they will be soon enough. And i will always believe the same about you. A woman\\'s heart should be so hidden in God that a man has to seek Him just to find her. Some people have a way with words, and other people...oh, uh, not have way. It ain\\'t what they call you, it\\'s what you answer to. It\\'s hard to enjoy practical jokes when your whole life feels like one. I\\'ve lived through some terrible things in my life, some of which actually happened. The real voyage of discovery consists not in seeking new landscapes, but in having new eyes. The best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others. Stop comparing yourself to other people, just choose to be happy and live your own life. I fell in love with her when we were together, then fell deeper in love with her in the years we were apart. The only thing better than imagining Dimitri carrying me in his arms was imagining him shirtless while carrying me in his arms. You\\'re a painter. You\\'re a baker. You like to sleep with the windows open. You never take sugar in your tea. And you always double-knot your shoelaces. There is a crack in everything.That\\'s how the light gets in. Stories can conquer fear, you know. They can make the heart bigger. Forbidden to remember, terrified to forget; it was a hard line to walk. I will love you always. When this red hair is white, I will still love you. When the smooth softness of youth is replaced by the delicate softness of age, I will still want to touch your skin. When your face is full of the lines of every smile you have ever smiled, of every surprise I have seen flash through your eyes, when every tear you have ever cried has left its mark upon your face,I will treasure you all the more, because I was there to see it all. I will share your life with you, Meredith, and I will love you until the last breath leaves your body or mine. As a woman I have no country. As a woman I want no country. As a woman, my country is the whole world. The emotion that can break your heart is sometimes the very one that heals it... Anyone can hide. Facing up to things, working through them, that\\'s what makes you strong. Don\\'t give in to your fears. If you do, you won\\'t be able to talk to your heart. Never be bullied into silence. Never allow yourself to be made a victim. Accept no one\\'s definition of your life, but define yourself. You are not rich until you have a rich heart. I don\\'t like people who have never fallen or stumbled. Their virtue is lifeless and it isn\\'t of much value. Life hasn\\'t revealed its beauty to them.  You never change your life until you step out of your comfort zone; change begins at the end of your comfort zone. Memories, even your most precious ones, fade surprisingly quickly. But I donâ€™t go along with that. The memories I value most, I donâ€™t ever see them fading. 1. Be Impeccable With Your WordSpeak with integrity. Say only what you mean. Avoid using the word to speak against yourself or to gossip about others. Use the power of your word in the direction of truth and love. 2. Don\\'t Take Anything PersonallyNothing others do is because of you. What others say and do is a projection of their own reality, their own dream. When you are immune to the opinions and actions of others, you won\\'t be the victim of needless suffering. 3. Don\\'t Make AssumptionsFind the courage to ask questions and to express what you really want. Communicate with others as clearly as you can to avoid misunderstandings, sadness and drama. With just this one agreement, you can completely transform your life. 4. Always Do Your BestYour best is going to change from moment to moment; it will be different when you are healthy as opposed to sick. Under any circumstance, simply do your best, and you will avoid self-judgment, self-abuse and regret. When we don\\'t know who to hate, we hate ourselves. When the first baby laughed for the first time, its laugh broke into a thousand pieces, and they all went skipping about, and that was the beginning of fairies. The more one judges, the less one loves. Better a cruel truth than a comfortable delusion. I must be a mermaid, Rango. I have no fear of depths and a great fear of shallow living. Selfishness is not living as one wishes to live, it is asking others to live as one wishes to live. Sometimes the Bible in the hand of one man is worse than a whisky bottle in the hand of (another)... There are just some kind of men who - who\\'re so busy worrying about the next world they\\'ve never learned to live in this one, and you can look down the street and see the results. Do not let the memories of your past limit the potential of your future. There are no limits to what you can achieve on your journey through life, except in your mind. A smile is a curve that sets everything straight. Remember me and smile, for it\\'s better to forget than to remember me and cry. Let the first act of every morning be to make the following resolve for the day:- I shall not fear anyone on Earth. - I shall fear only God. - I shall not bear ill will toward anyone. - I shall not submit to injustice from anyone. - I shall conquer untruth by truth. And in resisting untruth, I shall put up with all suffering. Did you see that dress?â€� \"I saw the dress.â€� \"Did you like it?â€� He didn\\'t answer. I took that as a yes. \"Am I going to endanger my reputation if I wear it to the dance?â€� When he spoke, I could barely hear him. \"You\\'ll endanger the school.â€� I smiled and fell asleep. One person\\'s craziness is another person\\'s reality. You are not special. You\\'re not a beautiful and unique snowflake. You\\'re the same decaying organic matter as everything else. We\\'re all part of the same compost heap. We\\'re all singing, all dancing crap of the world. I kept always two books in my pocket, one to read, one to write in. That\\'s the thing about depression: A human being can survive almost anything, as long as she sees the end in sight. But depression is so insidious, and it compounds daily, that it\\'s impossible to ever see the end. If I had my life to live over again, I would have made a rule to read some poetry and listen to some music at least once every week. May it be a light to you in dark places, when all other lights go out. They always say time changes things, but you actually have to change them yourself. I know we\\'re fucked up, alright? I\\'m impulsive, and hot tempered, and you get under my skin like no one else. You act like you hate me one minute, and then need me the next. I never get anything right, and I don\\'t deserve you...but I fucking love you, Abby. I love you more than I loved anyone or anything ever. When you\\'re around, I don\\'t need booze, or money, or the fighting, or the one-night stands... What she had realized was that love was that moment when your heart was about to burst. Anxiety is the dizziness of freedom. Things need not have happened to be true. Tales and dreams are the shadow-truths that will endure when mere facts are dust and ashes, and forgot. To choose doubt as a philosophy of life is akin to choosing immobility as a means of transportation. If you have good friends, no matter how much life is sucking , they can make you laugh. In the endthese things matter most:How well did you love?How fully did you live?How deeply did you let go? The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience, but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy. Do not think that love in order to be genuine has to be extraordinary. What we need is to love without getting tired. Be faithful in small things because it is in them that your strength lies. I always arrive late at the office, but I make up for it by leaving early. It doesn\\'t matter. I have books, new books, and I can bear anything as long as there are books. If you\\'re too open-minded; your brains will fall out. Kind words can be short and easy to speak, but their echoes are truly endless. Why do people say \"grow some balls\"? Balls are weak and sensitive. If you wanna be tough, grow a vagina. Those things can take a pounding. I hope you\\'re pleased with yourselves. We could all have been killed - or worse, expelled. Now if you don\\'t mind, I\\'m going to bed. Whatever you are physically...male or female, strong or weak, ill or healthy--all those things matter less than what your heart contains. If you have the soul of a warrior, you are a warrior. All those other things, they are the glass that contains the lamp, but you are the light inside. My rapier wit hides my inner pain. I say let the world go to hell, but I should always have my tea. Better to die fighting for freedom then be a prisoner all the days of your life. No sight so sad as that of a naughty child,\" he began, \"especially a naughty little girl. Do you know where the wicked go after death?\"\"They go to hell,\" was my ready and orthodox answer.\"And what is hell? Can you tell me that?\"\"A pit full of fire.\"\"And should you like to fall into that pit, and to be burning there for ever?\"\"No, sir.\"\"What must you do to avoid it?\"I deliberated a moment: my answer, when it did come was objectionable: \"I must keep in good health and not die. I\\'d rather die my way than live yours. Try to be a rainbow in someone\\'s cloud. Where words leave off, music begins. Morning is wonderful. Its only drawback is that it comes at such an inconvenient time of day. Life is too short to waste any amount of time on wondering what other people think about you. In the first place, if they had better things going on in their lives, they wouldn\\'t have the time to sit around and talk about you. What\\'s important to me is not others\\' opinions of me, but what\\'s important to me is my opinion of myself. I could die for you. But I couldn\\'t, and wouldn\\'t, live for you. I am lonely, yet not everybody will do. I don\\'t know why, some people fill the gaps and others emphasize my loneliness. In reality those who satisfy me are those who simply allow me to live with my \\'\\'idea of them. Headline?\" he asked.\"\\'Swing Set Needs Home,\\'\" I said.\"\\'Desperately Lonely Swing Set Needs Loving Home,\\'\" he said.\"\\'Lonely, Vaguely Pedophilic Swing Set Seeks the Butts of Children,\\'\" I said. The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing. I hope that in this year to come, you make mistakes.Because if you are making mistakes, then you are making new things, trying new things, learning, living, pushing yourself, changing yourself, changing your world. You\\'re doing things you\\'ve never done before, and more importantly, you\\'re Doing Something.So that\\'s my wish for you, and all of us, and my wish for myself. Make New Mistakes. Make glorious, amazing mistakes. Make mistakes nobody\\'s ever made before. Don\\'t freeze, don\\'t stop, don\\'t worry that it isn\\'t good enough, or it isn\\'t perfect, whatever it is: art, or love, or work or family or life.Whatever it is you\\'re scared of doing, Do it.Make your mistakes, next year and forever. If you have enough book space, I don\\'t want to talk to you. Holding Eleanor\\'s hand was like holding a butterfly. Or a heartbeat. Like holding something complete, and completely alive. Education: the path from cocky ignorance to miserable uncertainty. The truth will set you free. But not until it is finished with you. The only real prison is fear, and the only real freedom is freedom from fear I hope you will have a wonderful year, that you\\'ll dream dangerously and outrageously, that you\\'ll make something that didn\\'t exist before you made it, that you will be loved and that you will be liked, and that you will have people to love and to like in return. And, most importantly (because I think there should be more kindness and more wisdom in the world right now), that you will, when you need to be, be wise, and that you will always be kind. It\\'s the job that\\'s never started as takes longest to finish. I am not proud, but I am happy; and happiness blinds, I think, more than pride. I donâ€™t trust anybody. Not anybody. And the more that I care about someone, the more sure I am theyâ€™re going to get tired of me and take off. I can only note that the past is beautiful because one never realises an emotion at the time. It expands later, and thus we don\\'t have complete emotions about the present, only about the past. It takes courage to love, but pain through love is the purifying fire which those who love generously know. We all know people who are so much afraid of pain that they shut themselves up like clams in a shell and, giving out nothing, receive nothing and therefore shrink until life is a mere living death. Learn from the mistakes of others. You can never live long enough to make them all yourself. Great heroes need great sorrows and burdens, or half their greatness goes unnoticed. It is all part of the fairy tale. I have faith that God will show you the answer. But you have to understand that sometimes it takes a while to be able to recognize what God wants you to do. That\\'s how it often is. God\\'s voice is usually nothing more than a whisper, and you have to listen very carefully to hear it. But other times, in those rarest of moments, the answer is obvious and rings as loud as a church bell. There\\'s nowhere you can be that isn\\'t where you\\'re meant to be... Everything must be made as simple as possible. But not simpler. I guess thatâ€™s just part of loving people: You have to give things up. Sometimes you even have to give them up. They say I\\'m old-fashioned, and live in the past, but sometimes I think progress progresses too fast! Words dazzle and deceive because they are mimed by the face. But black words on a white page are the soul laid bare. When God Created Mothers\" When the Good Lord was creating mothers, He was into His sixth day of \"overtime\" when the angel appeared and said. \"You\\'re doing a lot of fiddling around on this one.\" And God said, \"Have you read the specs on this order?\" She has to be completely washable, but not plastic. Have 180 moveable parts...all replaceable. Run on black coffee and leftovers. Have a lap that disappears when she stands up. A kiss that can cure anything from a broken leg to a disappointed love affair. And six pairs of hands.\" The angel shook her head slowly and said. \"Six pairs of hands.... no way.\" It\\'s not the hands that are causing me problems,\" God remarked, \"it\\'s the three pairs of eyes that mothers have to have.\" That\\'s on the standard model?\" asked the angel. God nodded. One pair that sees through closed doors when she asks, \\'What are you kids doing in there?\\' when she already knows. Another here in the back of her head that sees what she shouldn\\'t but what she has to know, and of course the ones here in front that can look at a child when he goofs up and say. \\'I understand and I love you\\' without so much as uttering a word.\" God,\" said the angel touching his sleeve gently, \"Get some rest tomorrow....\" I can\\'t,\" said God, \"I\\'m so close to creating something so close to myself. Already I have one who heals herself when she is sick...can feed a family of six on one pound of hamburger...and can get a nine year old to stand under a shower.\" The angel circled the model of a mother very slowly. \"It\\'s too soft,\" she sighed. But tough!\" said God excitedly. \"You can imagine what this mother can do or endure.\" Can it think?\" Not only can it think, but it can reason and compromise,\" said the Creator. Finally, the angel bent over and ran her finger across the cheek. There\\'s a leak,\" she pronounced. \"I told You that You were trying to put too much into this model.\" It\\'s not a leak,\" said the Lord, \"It\\'s a tear.\" What\\'s it for?\" It\\'s for joy, sadness, disappointment, pain, loneliness, and pride.\" You are a genius, \" said the angel. Somberly, God said, \"I didn\\'t put it there. Sorrow is how we learn to love. Your heart isn\\'t breaking. It hurts because it\\'s getting larger. The larger it gets, the more love it holds. â€¨Loneliness is the human condition. Cultivate it. The way it tunnels into you allows your soul room to grow. Never expect to outgrow loneliness. Never hope to find people who will understand you, someone to fill that space. An intelligent, sensitive person is the exception, the very great exception. If you expect to find people who will understand you, you will grow murderous with disappointment. The best you\\'ll ever do is to understand yourself, know what it is that you want, and not let the cattle stand in your way. The most effective way to destroy people is to deny and obliterate their own understanding of their history. You do have a story inside you; it lies articulate and waiting to be written â€ behind your silence and your suffering. We sit silently and watch the world around us. This has taken a lifetime to learn. It seems only the old are able to sit next to one another and not say anything and still feel content. The young, brash and impatient, must always break the silence. It is a waste, for silence is pure. Silence is holy. It draws people together because only those who are comfortable with each other can sit without speaking. This is the great paradox. Trains are great dirty smoky things,\" said Will. \"You won\\'t like it.\" Tessa was unmoved. \"I won\\'t know if I like it until I try it, will I?\" \"I\\'ve never swum naked in the Thames before, but I know I wouldn\\'t like it.\" \"But think how entertaining for sightseers,\" said Tessa, and she saw Jem duck his head to hide the quick flash of his grin. When we\\'re incomplete, we\\'re always searching for somebody to complete us. When, after a few years or a few months of a relationship, we find that we\\'re still unfulfilled, we blame our partners and take up with somebody more promising. This can go on and on--series polygamy--until we admit that while a partner can add sweet dimensions to our lives, we, each of us, are responsible for our own fulfillment. Nobody else can provide it for us, and to believe otherwise is to delude ourselves dangerously and to program for eventual failure every relationship we enter. Freeing yourself was one thing, claiming ownership of that freed self was another. Between two evils, I always pick the one I never tried before. When the snows fall and the white winds blow, the lone wolf dies but the pack survives. An Unbreakable Vow?\" said Ron, looking stunned. \"Nah, he canâ€™t have.... Are you sure?\"\"Yes Iâ€™m sure,\" said Harry. \"Why, what does it mean?\"\"Well, you canâ€™t break an Unbreakable Vow...\"\"Iâ€™d worked that much out for myself, funnily enough. Curiouser and curiouser! Your silence will not protect you. The past is always tense, the future perfect. It is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done; it is a far, far better rest that I go to than I have ever known. Heaven knows we need never be ashamed of our tears, for they are rain upon the blinding dust of earth, overlying our hard hearts. I was better after I had cried, than before--more sorry, more aware of my own ingratitude, more gentle. I learned that courage was not the absence of fear, but the triumph over it. The brave man is not he who does not feel afraid, but he who conquers that fear. Atticus, he was real nice.\"\"Most people are, Scout, when you finally see them. He awoke each morning with the desire to do right, to be a good and meaningful person, to be, as simple as it sounded and as impossible as it actually was, happy. And during the course of each day his heart would descend from his chest into his stomach. By early afternoon he was overcome by the feeling that nothing was right, or nothing was right for him, and by the desire to be alone. By evening he was fulfilled: alone in the magnitude of his grief, alone in his aimless guilt, alone even in his loneliness. I am not sad, he would repeat to himself over and over, I am not sad. As if he might one day convince himself. Or fool himself. Or convince others--the only thing worse than being sad is for others to know that you are sad. I am not sad. I am not sad. Because his life had unlimited potential for happiness, insofar as it was an empty white room. He would fall asleep with his heart at the foot of his bed, like some domesticated animal that was no part of him at all. And each morning he would wake with it again in the cupboard of his rib cage, having become a little heavier, a little weaker, but still pumping. And by the midafternoon he was again overcome with the desire to be somewhere else, someone else, someone else somewhere else. I am not sad. Patience, grasshopper,\" said Maia. \"Good things come to those who wait.\"\"I always thought that was \\'Good things come to those who do the wave,\\'\" said Simon. \"No wonder I\\'ve been so confused all my life. The Very first moment I beheld him, my heart was irrevocably gone. The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death. To err is human, to forgive, divine. I\\'d rather be hated for who I am, than loved for who I am not. I am too intelligent, too demanding, and too resourceful for anyone to be able to take charge of me entirely. No one knows me or loves me completely. I have only myself No one ever told me that grief felt so like fear. Whenever you feel like criticizing any one...just remember that all the people in this world haven\\'t had the advantages that you\\'ve had. So many people walk around with a meaningless life. They seem half-asleep, even when they\\'re busy doing things they think are important. This is because they\\'re chasing the wrong things. The way you get meaning into your life is to devote yourself to loving others, devote yourself to your community around you, and devote yourself to creating something that gives you purpose and meaning. All I have seen teaches me to trust the Creator for all I have not seen. To be fully seen by somebody, then, and be loved anyhow - this is a human offering that can border on miraculous. In your light I learn how to love. In your beauty, how to make poems. You dance inside my chest where no-one sees you, but sometimes I do, and that sight becomes this art. The man who passes the sentence should swing the sword. If you would take a man\\'s life, you owe it to him to look into his eyes and hear his final words. And if you cannot bear to do that, then perhaps the man does not deserve to die. I don\\'t know who invented high heels, but all women owe him a lot! The major problemâ€one of the major problems, for there are severalâ€one of the many major problems with governing people is that of whom you get to do it; or rather of who manages to get people to let them do it to them. To summarize: it is a well-known fact that those people who must want to rule people are, ipso facto, those least suited to do it. To summarize the summary: anyone who is capable of getting themselves made President should on no account be allowed to do the job. Let the improvement of yourself keep you so busy that you have no time to criticize others. What is family? They were the people who claimed you. In good, in bad, in parts or in whole, they were the ones who showed up, who stayed in there, regardless. It wasn\\'t just about blood relations or shared chromosomes, but something wider, bigger. We had many families over time. Our family of origin, the family we created, and the groups you moved through while all of this was happening: friends, lovers, sometimes even strangers. None of them perfect, and we couldn\\'t expect them to be. You can\\'t make any one person your world. The trick was to take what each could give you and build your world from it. Sometimes I wonder if there\\'s something wrong with me. Perhaps I\\'ve spent too long in the company of my literary romantic heroes, and consequently my ideals and expectations are far too high. If the real world were a book, it would never find a publisher. Overlong, detailed to the point of distraction-and ultimately, without a major resolution. It\\'s going to be all right, sir,\" Harry said over and over again, more worried by Dumbledore\\'s silence than he had been by his weakened voice. \"We\\'re nearly there ... I can Apparate us both back ... don\\'t worry ...\"\"I am not worried, Harry,\" said Dumbledore, his voice a little stronger despite the freezing water. \"I am with you. Second star to the right and straight on \\'til morning.  You\\'re the first Shadowhunter I\\'ve ever met.\" â€œThatâ€™s too bad,â€� said Jace, â€œsince all the others you meet from now on will be a terrible letdown. When will you learn that there isn\\'t a word for everything? Alec looked at her and shook his head. \"How do you manage never to get mud on your clothes?\"Isabelle shrugged philosophically. \"I\\'m pure at heart. It repels the dirt. Evil is always possible. And goodness is eternally difficult. When you have lost hope, you have lost everything. And when you think all is lost, when all is dire and bleak, there is always hope. What a blessing it is to love books as I love them;- to be able to converse with the dead, and to live amidst the unreal! Why are you worrying about YOU-KNOW-WHO, when you should be worrying about YOU-NO-POO? The constipation sensation that\\'s gripping the nation! Words, I think, are such unpredictable creatures. No gun, no sword, no army or king will ever be more powerful than a sentence. Swords may cut and kill, but words will stab and stay, burying themselves in our bones to become corpses we carry into the future, all the time digging and failing to rip their skeletons from our flesh. Blessed are the hearts that can bend; they shall never be broken. Magnus, standing by the door, snapped his fingers impatiently. \"Move it along, teenagers. The only person who gets to canoodle in my bedroom is my magnificent self.\"\"Canoodle?\" repeated Clary, never having heard the word before.\"Magnificent?\" repeated Jace, who was just being nasty. Magnus growled. The growl sounded like \"Get out. Man only likes to count his troubles; he doesn\\'t calculate his happiness. I\\'m killing time while I wait for life to shower me with meaning and happiness. The best way to cheer yourself is to try to cheer someone else up. I was dead until you found me, though I breathed. I was sightless, though I could see. And then you came...and I was awakened. Youâ€™re dangerous,â€� he says.â€œWhy?â€�â€œBecause you make me believe in the impossible Educating the mind without educating the heart is no education at all. The price good men pay for indifference to public affairs is to be ruled by evil men. Once you have read a book you care about, some part of it is always with you. Ignore those that make you fearful and sad, that degrade you back towards disease and death. And then something invisible snapped insider her, and that which had come together commenced to fall apart. The two hardest tests on the spiritual road are the patience to wait for the right moment and the courage not to be disappointed with what we encounter. Those who can make you believe absurdities, can make you commit atrocities. I write to give myself strength. I write to be the characters that I am not. I write to explore all the things I\\'m afraid of.  Books serve to show a man that those original thoughts of his aren\\'t very new after all. You might want to lie down,\" Magnus advised. \"I find that it helps when the crushing sense of horrible realization sets in. The world was collapsing, and the only thing that really mattered to me was that she was alive. Parents can only give good advice or put them on the right paths, but the final forming of a person\\'s character lies in their own hands. Um...is that thing tame?\" Frank said.The horse whinnied angrily.\"I don\\'t think so,\" Percy guessed. \"He just said, \\'I will trample you to death, silly Chinese Canadian baby man\\'. This is how you do it: you sit down at the keyboard and you put one word after another until its done. It\\'s that easy, and that hard. They\\'re certainly entitled to think that, and they\\'re entitled to full respect for their opinions... but before I can live with other folks I\\'ve got to live with myself. The one thing that doesn\\'t abide by majority rule is a person\\'s conscience. In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I\\'ve been turning over in my mind ever since.\"Whenever you feel like criticizing any one,\" he told me, \"just remember that all the people in this world haven\\'t had the advantages that you\\'ve had. You should write because you love the shape of stories and sentences and the creation of different words on a page. Writing comes from reading, and reading is the finest teacher of how to write. People tend to complicate their own lives, as if living weren\\'t already complicated enough. make a radical change in your lifestyle and begin to boldly do things which you may previously never have thought of doing, or been too hesitant to attempt. So many people live within unhappy circumstances and yet will not take the initiative to change their situation because they are conditioned to a life of security, conformity, and conservation, all of which may appear to give one peace of mind, but in reality nothing is more damaging to the adventurous spirit within a man than a secure future. The very basic core of a man\\'s living spirit is his passion for adventure. The joy of life comes from our encounters with new experiences, and hence there is no greater joy than to have an endlessly changing horizon, for each day to have a new and different sun. If you want to get more out of life, you must lose your inclination for monotonous security and adopt a helter-skelter style of life that will at first appear to you to be crazy. But once you become accustomed to such a life you will see its full meaning and its incredible beauty. Maybe our girlfriends are our soulmates and guys are just people to have fun with. The earth has its music for those who will listen When one is in love, one always begins by deceiving one\\'s self, and one always ends by deceiving others. That is what the world calls a romance. A man who dares to waste one hour of time has not discovered the value of life. We do not need magic to transform our world. We carry all of the power we need inside ourselves already. When I say it\\'s you I like, I\\'m talking about that part of you that knows that life is far more than anything you can ever see or hear or touch. That deep part of you that allows you to stand for those things without which humankind cannot survive. Love that conquers hate, peace that rises triumphant over war, and justice that proves more powerful than greed. I wonder how many people don\\'t get the one they want, but end up with the one they\\'re supposed to be with. When we are young, the words are scattered all around us. As they are assembled by experience, so also are we, sentence by sentence, until the story takes shape. All happiness depends on courage and work. Be thankful for what you have; you\\'ll end up having more. If you concentrate on what you don\\'t have, you will never, ever have enough. All good books are alike in that they are truer than if they had really happened and after you are finished reading one you will feel that all that happened to you and afterwards it all belongs to you: the good and the bad, the ecstasy, the remorse and sorrow, the people and the places and how the weather was. If you can get so that you can give that to people, then you are a writer. The supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting. Holding anger is a poison...It eats you from inside...We think that by hating someone we hurt them...But hatred is a curved blade...and the harm we do to others...we also do to ourselves. I have nothing to declare except my genius. The earth laughs in flowers. When someone is in your heart, they\\'re never truly gone. They can come back to you, even at unlikely times. Even After All this timeThe Sun never says to the Earth,\"You owe me.\"LookWhat happensWith a love like that,It lights the whole sky. But I didn\\'t understand then. That I could hurt somebody so badly she would never recover. That a person can, just by living, damage another human being beyond repair. You only live twice:Once when you are bornAnd once when you look death in the face I don\\'t go out with strangers,\" I said.\"Good thing I do. I\\'ll pick you up at five. We are each our own devil, and we make this world our hell. To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow,Creeps in this petty pace from day to day,To the last syllable of recorded time;And all our yesterdays have lighted foolsThe way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!Life\\'s but a walking shadow, a poor player,That struts and frets his hour upon the stage,And then is heard no more. It is a taleTold by an idiot, full of sound and fury,Signifying nothing. Reality doesn\\'t impress me. I only believe in intoxication, in ecstasy, and when ordinary life shackles me, I escape, one way or another. No more walls. Wanting to be someone else is a waste of the person you are. I know it\\'s wrong - God, it\\'s all kinds of wrong - but I just want to lie down with you and wake up with you, just once, just once ever in my life. The future depends on what you do today. Trees that are slow to grow bear the best fruit. Only people who are capable of loving strongly can also suffer great sorrow, but this same necessity of loving serves to counteract their grief and heals them. If death meant just leaving the stage long enough to change costume and come back as a new character...Would you slow down? Or speed up? The only truth is music. Laughter is wine for the soul - laughter soft, or loud and deep, tinged through with seriousness - the hilarious declaration made by man that life is worth living. If you never did you should. These things are fun and fun is good. Intelligence plus character-that is the goal of true education. The mark of the immature man is that he wants to die nobly for a cause, while the mark of the mature man is that he wants to live humbly for one. Only a generation of readers will spawn a generation of writers. I can\\'t eat and I can\\'t sleep. I\\'m not doing well in terms of being a functional human, you know? You care so much you feel as though you will bleed to death with the pain of it. Do not spoil what you have by desiring what you have not; remember that what you now have was once among the things you only hoped for. Can you surf really well, then?\"I looked at Grover, who was trying hard not to laugh.\"Jeez, Nico,\" I said. \"I\\'ve never really tried.\"He went on asking questions. Did I fight a lot with Thalia, since she was a daughter of Zeus? (I didn\\'t answer that one.) If Annabeth\\'s mother was Athena, the goddess of wisdom, then why didn\\'t Annabeth know better than to fall off a cliff? (I tried not to strangle Nico for asking that one.) Was Annabeth my girlfriend? (At this point, I was ready to stick the kid in a meat-flavored sack and throw him to the wolves.) Books are no more threatened by Kindle than stairs by elevators. There is more than one way to burn a book. And the world is full of people running about with lit matches. The question is not what you look at, but what you see. I was always hungry for love. Just once, I wanted to know what it was like to get my fill of it -- to be fed so much love I couldn\\'t take any more. Just once.  ...you know that a good, long session of weeping can often make you feel better, even if your circumstances have not changed one bit. Don\\'t cry over someone who wouldn\\'t cry over you. You can only be young once. But you can always be immature. The things you used to own, now they own you. If, then, I were asked for the most important advice I could give, that which I considered to be the most useful to the men of our century, I should simply say: in the name of God, stop a moment, cease your work, look around you. You deal with mythological stuff for a few years, you learn that paradises are usually places where you get killed. If someone were to harm my family or a friend or somebody I love, I would eat them. I might end up in jail for 500 years, but I would eat them. If you want to get laid, go to college. If you want an education, go to the library. Hope is a waking dream. We can\\'t be afraid of change. You may feel very secure in the pond that you are in, but if you never venture out of it, you will never know that there is such a thing as an ocean, a sea. Holding onto something that is good for you now, may be the very reason why you don\\'t have something better. to love life, to love it evenwhen you have no stomach for itand everything you\\'ve held dearcrumbles like burnt paper in your hands,your throat filled with the silt of it.When grief sits with you, its tropical heatthickening the air, heavy as watermore fit for gills than lungs;when grief weights you like your own fleshonly more of it, an obesity of grief,you think, How can a body withstand this?Then you hold life like a facebetween your palms, a plain face,no charming smile, no violet eyes,and you say, yes, I will take youI will love you, again. The good thing about science is that it\\'s true whether or not you believe in it. God, but life is loneliness, despite all the opiates, despite the shrill tinsel gaiety of \"parties\" with no purpose, despite the false grinning faces we all wear. And when at last you find someone to whom you feel you can pour out your soul, you stop in shock at the words you utter - they are so rusty, so ugly, so meaningless and feeble from being kept in the small cramped dark inside you so long. Yes, there is joy, fulfillment and companionship - but the loneliness of the soul in its appalling self-consciousness is horrible and overpowering. He died not for men, but for each man. If each man had been the only man made, He would have done no less. I got schooled this yearbyaboy.A boy that I\\'m seriously, deeply, madly, incredibly, and undeniably in  Iâ€™ve been fighting to be who I am all my life. Whatâ€™s the point of being who I am, if I canâ€™t have the person who was worth all the fighting for? Absence diminishes small loves and increases great ones, as the wind blows out the candle and fans the bonfire. Those who cannot change their minds cannot change anything. Have you ever lost someone you love and wanted one more conversation, one more chance to make up for the time when you thought they would be here forever? If so, then you know you can go your whole life collecting days, and none will outweigh the one you wish you had back. Literature is a textually transmitted disease, normally contracted in childhood. A well-composed book is a magic carpet on which we are wafted to a world that we cannot enter in any other way. We need not to be let alone. We need to be really bothered once in a while. How long is it since you were really bothered? About something important, about something real? Anybody can sympathise with the sufferings of a friend, but it requires a very fine nature to sympathise with a friend\\'s success. We do not believe in ourselves until someone reveals that deep inside us something is valuable, worth listening to, worthy of our trust, sacred to our touch. Once we believe in ourselves we can risk curiosity, wonder, spontaneous delight or any experience that reveals the human spirit. If books could have more, give more, be more, show more, they would still need readers who bring to them sound and smell and light and all the rest that canâ€™t be in books.\\tThe book needs you. If you\\'re texting Magnus to say \\'I think u r kewl,\\' I\\'m going to kill you.\"\"Who\\'s Magnus?\" Max inquired.\"He\\'s a warlock,\" said Alec.\"A sexy, sexy warlock,\" Isabelle told Max, ignoring Alec\\'s look of total fury.\"But warlocks are bad,\" protested Max, looking baffled.\"Exactly,\" said Isabelle. If no one cares for you at all, do you even really exist? there are two types of people in the world: those who prefer to be sad among others, and those who prefer to be sad alone. I imagine one of the reasons people cling to their hates so stubbornly is because they sense, once hate is gone, they will be forced to deal with pain. Heard melodies are sweet, but those unheard, are sweeter Sometimes love means letting go when you want to hold on tighter. A man\\'s face is his autobiography. A woman\\'s face is her work of fiction. Always be a poet, even in prose. The power of a glance has been so much abused in love stories, that it has come to be disbelieved in. Few people dare now to say that two beings have fallen in love because they have looked at each other. Yet it is in this way that love begins, and in this way only. Incredible change happens in your life when you decide to take control of what you do have power over instead of craving control over what you don\\'t. I believe in God, but not as one thing, not as an old man in the sky. I believe that what people call God is something in all of us. I believe that what Jesus and Mohammed and Buddha and all the rest said was right. It\\'s just that the translations have gone wrong. A mother is the truest friend we have, when trials heavy and sudden fall upon us; when adversity takes the place of prosperity; when friends desert us; when trouble thickens around us, still will she cling to us, and endeavor by her kind precepts and counsels to dissipate the clouds of darkness, and cause peace to return to our hearts. I know how devastated you must be to miss me, but leave a message, and I\\'ll try to ease your agony Did you really want to die?\"\"No one commits suicide because they want to die.\"\"Then why do they do it?\"\"Because they want to stop the pain. The past is never where you think you left it. The homemaker has the ultimate career. All other careers exist for one purpose only - and that is to support the ultimate career.  I want to be in a relationship where you telling me you love me is just a ceremonious validation of what you already show me. There are moments when troubles enter our lives and we can do nothing to avoid them.But they are there for a reason. Only when we have overcome them will we understand why they were there. You could say sorry,\" suggested Harry bluntly. \"What, and get attacked by another flock of canaries?\" muttered Ron.\"What did you have to imitate her for?\"\"She laughed at my mustache!\"\"So did I, it was the stupidest thing I\\'ve ever seen. Dreams are always crushing when they don\\'t come true. But it\\'s the simple dreams that are often the most painful because they seem so personal, so reasonable, so attainable. You\\'re always close enough to touch, but never quite close enough to hold and it\\'s enough to break your heart. Demon pox, oh demon poxJust how is it acquired?One must go down to the bad part of townUntil one is very tired.Demon pox, oh demon pox, I had it all alongâ€Not the pox, you foolish blocks,I mean this very songâ€For I was right, and you were wrong!\"\"Will!\" Charlotte shouted over the noise, \"Have you LOST YOUR MIND? CEASE THAT INFERNAL RACKET! Jemâ€\" Jem, rising to his feet, clapped his hands over Will\\'s mouth. \"Do you promise to be quiet?\" he hissed into his friend\\'s ear.Will nodded, blue eyes blazing. Tessa was staring at him in amazement; they all were. She had seen Will many thingsâ€amused, bitter, condescending, angry, pityingâ€but never giddy before.Jem let him go. \"All right, then.\"Will slid to the floor, his back against the armchair, and threw up his arms. \"A demon pox on all your houses!\" he announced, and yawned.\"Oh, God, weeks of pox jokes,\" said Jem. \"We\\'re in for it now. We dream to give ourselves hope. To stop dreaming - well, thatâ€™s like saying you can never change your fate. Nothing travels faster than the speed of light, with the possible exception of bad news, which obeys its own special laws. In one aspect, yes, I believe in ghosts, but we create them. We haunt ourselves. Fashion is a form of ugliness so intolerable that we have to alter it every six months. Great minds discuss ideas. Average minds discuss events. Small minds discuss people. I don\\'t mind making jokes, but I don\\'t want to look like one. Nothing in life is to be feared, it is only to be understood. Now is the time to understand more, so that we may fear less. A small but noteworthy note. I\\'ve seen so many young men over the years who think they\\'re running at other young men. They are not. They are running at me. I\\'m happy. Which often looks like crazy. I guess that\\'s what saying good-bye is always like--like jumping off an edge. The worst part is making the choice to do it. Once you\\'re in the air, there\\'s nothing you can do but let go. Most men would rather deny a hard truth than face it. Men go to far greater lengths to avoid what they fear than to obtain what they desire. Life is either a daring adventure or nothing at all. He felt that his whole life was some kind of dream and he sometimes wondered whose it was and whether they were enjoying it. There is a pleasure in the pathless woods,There is a rapture on the lonely shore,There is society, where none intrudes,By the deep sea, and music in its roar:I love not man the less, but Nature more Well, she\\'s not responding to my advances,\" he observed more brightly than he felt, \"so she must be dead.\" \"Or she\\'s a woman of good taste and sense. Iâ€™m not in this world to live up to your expectations and youâ€™re not in this world to live up to mine. Freedom lies in being bold. Gus: \"It tastes like...\"Me: \"Food.\"Gus: \"Yes, precisely. It tastes like food, excellently prepared. But it does not taste, how do I put this delicately...?\"Me: \"It does not taste like God Himself cooked heaven into a series of five dishes which were then served to you accompanied by several luminous balls of fermented, bubbly plasma while actual and literal flower petals floated down around your canal-side dinner table.\"Gus: \"Nicely phrased.\"Gus\\'s father: \"Our children are weird.\"My dad: \"Nicely phrased. If you stay, I\\'ll do whatever you want. I\\'ll quit the band, go with you to New York. But if you need me to go away, I\\'ll do that, too. I was talking to Liz and she said maybe coming back to your old life would be too painful, that maybe it\\'d be easier for you to erase us. And that would suck, but I\\'d do it. I can lose you like that if I don\\'t lose you today. I\\'ll let you go. If you stay. A paranoid is someone who knows a little of what\\'s going on.  You are okay?\" he asked. \"Not eaten by monsters?\"\"Not even a little bit.\" I showed him that I still had both arms and both legs, and Tyson clapped happily.\"Yay!\" he said. \"Now we can eat peanut butter sandwiches and ride fish ponies! We can fight monsters and see Annabeth and make things go BOOM!\"I hoped he didn\\'t mean all at the same time, but I told him absolutely, we\\'d have a lot of fun this summer. The impossible could not have happened, therefore the impossible must be possible in spite of appearances. The best way to not feel hopeless is to get up and do something. Donâ€™t wait for good things to happen to you. If you go out and make some good things happen, you will fill the world with hope, you will fill yourself with hope. The surest way to corrupt a youth is to instruct him to hold in higher esteem those who think alike than those who think differently. If you have the words, there\\'s always a chance that you\\'ll find the way. Stories you read when you\\'re the right age never quite leave you. You may forget who wrote them or what the story was called. Sometimes you\\'ll forget precisely what happened, but if a story touches you it will stay with you, haunting the places in your mind that you rarely ever visit. Many people will walk in and out of your life, but only true friends will leave footprints in your heart I sit beside the fire and think Of all that I have seenOf meadow flowers and butterfliesIn summers that have beenOf yellow leaves and gossamerIn autumns that there wereWith morning mist and silver sunAnd wind upon my hairI sit beside the fire and thinkOf how the world will beWhen winter comes without a spring That I shall ever seeFor still there are so many thingsThat I have never seenIn every wood in every springThere is a different greenI sit beside the fire and thinkOf people long agoAnd people that will see a worldThat I shall never knowBut all the while I sit and thinkOf times there were beforeI listen for returning feet And voices at the door Have you tried talking to her?\" \"No. We\\'ve been punching her in the face repeatedly. What? You don\\'t think that will work? With enough courage, you can do without a reputation. Name the greatest of all inventors. Accident. Keep your face always toward the sunshine - and shadows will fall behind you. Watch out for intellect,because it knows so much it knows nothingand leaves you hanging upside down,mouthing knowledge as your heartfalls out of your mouth. All our dreams can come true, if we have the courage to pursue them. Imagination is like a muscle. I found out that the more I wrote, the bigger it got. The advantage of a bad memory is that one enjoys several times the same good things for the first time. Your visions will become clear only when you can look into your own heart. Who looks outside, dreams; who looks inside, awakes. Mental pain is less dramatic than physical pain, but it is more common and also more hard to bear. The frequent attempt to conceal mental pain increases the burden: it is easier to say â€œMy tooth is achingâ€� than to say â€œMy heart is broken. Alone. Yes, that\\'s the key word, the most awful word in the English tongue. Murder doesn\\'t hold a candle to it and hell is only a poor synonym. Nothing takes the taste out of peanut butter quite like unrequited love. You can\\'t wait for inspiration. You have to go after it with a club. When you trip over love, it is easy to get up. But when you fall in love, it is impossible to stand again. Usually we walk around constantly believing ourselves. \"I\\'m okay\" we say. \"I\\'m alright\". But sometimes the truth arrives on you and you can\\'t get it off. That\\'s when you realize that sometimes it isn\\'t even an answer--it\\'s a question. Even now, I wonder how much of my life is convinced. The more clearly we can focus our attention on the wonders and realities of the universe about us, the less taste we shall have for destruction. You think because he doesn\\'t love you that you are worthless. You think that because he doesn\\'t want you anymore that he is right -- that his judgement and opinion of you are correct. If he throws you out, then you are garbage. You think he belongs to you because you want to belong to him. Don\\'t. It\\'s a bad word, \\'belong.\\' Especially when you put it with somebody you love. Love shouldn\\'t be like that. Did you ever see the way the clouds love a mountain? They circle all around it; sometimes you can\\'t even see the mountain for the clouds. But you know what? You go up top and what do you see? His head. The clouds never cover the head. His head pokes through, beacuse the clouds let him; they don\\'t wrap him up. They let him keep his head up high, free, with nothing to hide him or bind him. You can\\'t own a human being. You can\\'t lose what you don\\'t own. Suppose you did own him. Could you really love somebody who was absolutely nobody without you? You really want somebody like that? Somebody who falls apart when you walk out the door? You don\\'t, do you? And neither does he. You\\'re turning over your whole life to him. Your whole life, girl. And if it means so little to you that you can just give it away, hand it to him, then why should it mean any more to him? He can\\'t value you more than you value yourself. So light a fire!\" Harry choked. \"Yes...of course...but there\\'s no wood!\" ... \"HAVE YOU GONE MAD!\" Ron bellowed. \"ARE YOU A WITCH OR NOT! I decided it is better to scream. Silence is the real crime against humanity. Whoever is careless with the truth in small matters cannot be trusted with important matters Will rolled up his sleeves. \"We\\'ll probably have to knock down the door--\" \"Or,\" said Jem, reaching out and giving the knob a twist, \"not.\" The door swung open onto a rectangle of darkness. \"Now, that\\'s simply laziness,\" said Will. I am both happy and sad at the same time, and I\\'m still trying to figure out how that could be. Another belief of mine: that everyone else my age is an adult, whereas I am merely in disguise. Autumn is a second spring when every leaf is a flower. Atticus said to Jem one day, \"Iâ€™d rather you shot at tin cans in the backyard, but I know youâ€™ll go after birds. Shoot all the blue jays you want, if you can hit â€˜em, but remember itâ€™s a sin to kill a mockingbird.\" That was the only time I ever heard Atticus say it was a sin to do something, and I asked Miss Maudie about it. \"Your fatherâ€™s right,\" she said. \"Mockingbirds donâ€™t do one thing except make music for us to enjoy. They donâ€™t eat up peopleâ€™s gardens, donâ€™t nest in corn cribs, they donâ€™t do one thing but sing their hearts out for us. Thatâ€™s why itâ€™s a sin to kill a mockingbird. Being with you never felt wrong. It\\'s the one thing I did right. You\\'re the one thing I did right. Is man merely a mistake of God\\'s? Or God merely a mistake of man? Shoot for the moon. Even if you miss, you\\'ll land among the stars. For me, I am driven by two main philosophies: know more today about the world than I knew yesterday and lessen the suffering of others. You\\'d be surprised how far that gets you. there is a place in the heart thatwill never be filleda spaceand even during thebest momentsandthe greatest timestimeswe will know itwe will know itmore thaneverthere is a place in the heart thatwill never be filledandwe will waitandwaitin that space. I decided as long as I\\'m going to hell, I might as well do it thoroughly. Youâ€™ll get over itâ€¦â€� Itâ€™s the clichÃ©s that cause the trouble. To lose someone you love is to alter your life for ever. You donâ€™t get over it because â€˜itâ€� is the person you loved. The pain stops, there are new people, but the gap never closes. How could it? The particularness of someone who mattered enough to grieve over is not made anodyne by death. This hole in my heart is in the shape of you and no-one else can fit it. Why would I want them to? Do not set aside your happiness. Do not wait to be happy in the future. The best time to be happy is always now. Good sex is like good bridge. If you don\\'t have a good partner, you\\'d better have a good hand. ...and then, I have nature and art and poetry, and if that is not enough, what is enough? How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.I love thee to the depth and breadth and heightMy soul can reach He was the crazy one who had painted himself black and defeated the world.She was the book thief without the words.Trust me, though, the words were on their way, and when they arrived, Liesel would hold them in her hands like the clouds, and she would wring them out like rain. Whenever people agree with me I always feel I must be wrong. I was not a pet, not a doll, not an animal.I was a survivor, and I was strong.I would not be weak, or helpless again I would not, could not be broken. Tamed. Without you in my arms, I feel an emptiness in my soul. I find myself searching the crowds for your face - I know it\\'s an impossibility, but I cannot help myself. Women want love to be a novel. Men, a short story. When I do good, I feel good. When I do bad, I feel bad. That\\'s my religion. Of course motivation is not permanent. But then, neither is bathing; but it is something you should do on a regular basis. Never miss a good chance to shut up. If all the world hated you and believed you wicked, while your own conscience approved of you and absolved you from guilt, you would not be without friends. I hate men who are afraid of women\\'s strength. Never marry at all, Dorian. Men marry because they are tired, women, because they are curious: both are disappointed. Well-read people are less likely to be evil. There will be a few times in your life when all your instincts will tell you to do something, something that defies logic, upsets your plans, and may seem crazy to others. When that happens, you do it. Listen to your instincts and ignore everything else. Ignore logic, ignore the odds, ignore the complications, and just go for it. I suffer from girlnextdooritis where the guy is friends with you and that\\'s it. What draws people to be friends is that they see the same truth. They share it. Look at everything always as though you were seeing it either for the first or last time: Thus is your time on earth filled with glory. Behind this mask there is more than just flesh. Beneath this mask there is an idea... and ideas are bulletproof. The course of true love never did run smooth. The best way out is always through. Science is not only compatible with spirituality; it is a profound source of spirituality. How long was I asleep?\" she whispered. He didn\\'t respond. \"How long was I asleep?\" she asked again, and noticed a hint of red in his cheeks. \"You were asleep, too?\" \"Until you began drooling on my shoulder. Sometimes, the best way to help someone is just to be near them. You believe in a book that has talking animals, wizards, witches, demons, sticks turning into snakes, burning bushes, food falling from the sky, people walking on water, and all sorts of magical, absurd and primitive stories, and you say that we are the ones that need help? I am awfully greedy; I want everything from life. I want to be a woman and to be a man, to have many friends and to have loneliness, to work much and write good books, to travel and enjoy myself, to be selfish and to be unselfishâ€¦ You see, it is difficult to get all which I want. And then when I do not succeed I get mad with anger. What\\'s up?\" I asked.You tell me,\" he said. \"You were the one about ready to start making out with Adrian.\"It was an experiment,\" I said. \"It was part of my therapy.\"What the hell kind of therapy are you in? This is a new year. A new beginning. And things will change. District 12: Where you can starve to death in safety. Why do beautiful songs make you sad?\\' \\'Because they aren\\'t true.\\' \\'Never?\\' \\'Nothing is beautiful and true. There must be something in books, something we canâ€™t imagine, to make a woman stay in a burning house; there must be something there. You donâ€™t stay for nothing. Now that she had nothing to lose, she was free. Luxury is not a necessity to me, but beautiful and good things are. It would seem that Our Lord finds our desires not too strong, but too weak. We are half-hearted creatures, fooling about with drink and sex and ambition when infinite joy is offered us, like an ignorant child who wants to go on making mud pies in a slum because he cannot imagine what is meant by the offer of a holiday at the sea. We are far too easily pleased. I guess by now I should know enough about loss to realize that you never really stop missing someone-you just learn to live around the huge gaping hole of their absence. What\\'s terrible is to pretend that second-rate is first-rate. To pretend that you don\\'t need love when you do; or you like your work when you know quite well you\\'re capable of better. All thinking men are atheists. Courage isn\\'t having the strength to go on - it is going on when you don\\'t have strength. Anti-intellectualism has been a constant thread winding its way through our political and cultural life, nurtured by the false notion that democracy means that \\'my ignorance is just as good as your knowledge.\\' The sunlight claps the earth, and the moonbeams kiss the sea: what are all these kissings worth, if thou kiss not me? The most terrible poverty is loneliness, and the feeling of being unloved. The worst type of crying wasn\\'t the kind everyone could see--the wailing on street corners, the tearing at clothes. No, the worst kind happened when your soul wept and no matter what you did, there was no way to comfort it. A section withered and became a scar on the part of your soul that survived. For people like me and Echo, our souls contained more scar tissue than life. To survive, you must tell stories. A girl calls and asks, \"Does it hurt very much to die?\"\"Well, sweetheart,\" I tell her, \"yes, but it hurts a lot more to keep living. However many holy words you read, however many you speak, what good will they do you if you do not act on upon them? He who knows all the answers has not been asked all the questions. Let no one ever come to you without leaving better and happier. Be the living expression of God\\'s kindness: kindness in your face, kindness in your eyes, kindness in your smile. The more I read, the more I acquire, the more certain I am that I know nothing. You get what anybody gets - you get a lifetime. Feminism is the radical notion that women are human beings. All human wisdom is contained in these two words - Wait and Hope Oh, we\\'re playing nice now? Shall we have tea first? Brew up a nice pot of kiss-my-ass? Stop fighting me!\" he said, trying to pull on the arm he held.He was in a precarious position himself, straddling the rail as he tried to lean over far enough to get me and actually hold onto me.â€œLet go of me!â€� I yelled back.But he was too strong and managed to haul most of me over the rail, enough so that I wasnâ€™t in total danger of falling again.See, hereâ€™s the thing. In that moment before I let go, I really had been contemplating my death. Iâ€™d come to terms with it and accepted it. I also, however, had known Dimitri might do something exactly like this. He was just that fast and that good. That was why I was holding my stake in the hand that was dangling free.I looked him in the eye. \"I will always love you.\"Then I plunged the stake into his chest.It wasnâ€™t as precise a blow as I would have liked, not with the skilled way he was dodging. I struggled to get the stake in deep enough to his heart, unsure if I could do it from this angle. Then, his struggles stopped. His eyes stared at me, stunned, and his lips parted, almost into a smile, albeit a grisly and pained one.\"Thatâ€™s what I was supposed to say. . .â€� he gasped out.Those were his last words. No good deed goes unpunished. The desire to reach for the stars is ambitious. The desire to reach hearts is wise. The things we love destroy us every time, lad. Remember that. Man is the cruelest animal. Always be a first rate version of yourself and not a second rate version of someone else. Sometimes you lose a battle. But mischief always wins the war God alert!\" Blackjack yelled. \"It\\'s the wine dude!Mr. D sighed in exasperation. \"The next person, or horse, who calls me the \\'wine dude\\' will end up in a bottle of Merlot! Humor is reason gone mad. It is nothing to die. It is frightful not to live. Maybe this world is another planetâ€™s hell. Seventeen, eh!\" said Hagrid as he accepted a bucket-sized glass of wine from Fred.\"Six years to the day we met, Harry, dâ€™yeh remember it?\"\"Vaguely,\" said Harry, grinning up at him. \"Didnâ€™t you smash down the front door, give Dudley a pigâ€™s tail, and tell me I was a wizard?\"\"I forgeâ€™ the details,\" Hagrid chortled. Scars have the strange power to remind us that our past is real. We learn from failure, not from success! God does not play dice with the universe; He plays an ineffable game of His own devising, which might be compared, from the perspective of any of the other players [i.e. everybody], to being involved in an obscure and complex variant of poker in a pitch-dark room, with blank cards, for infinite stakes, with a Dealer who won\\'t tell you the rules, and who smiles all the time. Marriage can wait, education cannot. We donâ€™t need a list of rights and wrongs, tables of dos and donâ€™ts: we need books, time, and silence. Thou shalt not is soon forgotten, but Once upon a time lasts forever. The greatness of a nation and its moral progress can be judged by the way its animals are treated. There are much worse games to play. I never forget a face, but in your case I\\'ll be glad to make an exception. This is where it all begins. Everything starts here, today. But until a person can say deeply and honestly, \"I am what I am today because of the choices I made yesterday,\" that person cannot say, \"I choose otherwise. I know not all that may be coming, but be it what it will, I\\'ll go to it laughing. Do you not see how necessary a world of pains and troubles is to school an intelligence and make it a soul? A short story is a different thing altogether â€ a short story is like a quick kiss in the dark from a stranger. To give pleasure to a single heart by a single act is better than a thousand heads bowing in prayer. There are perhaps many causes worth dying for, but to me, certainly, there are none worth killing for. Don\\'t let the muggles get you down. He allowed himself to be swayed by his conviction that human beings are not born once and for all on the day their mothers give birth to them, but that life obliges them over and over again to give birth to themselves. No great mind has ever existed without a touch of madness. The mountains are calling and I must go. My religion is very simple. My religion is kindness. Five exclamation marks, the sure sign of an insane mind. She was a genius of sadness, immersing herself in it, separating its numerous strands, appreciating its subtle nuances. She was a prism through which sadness could be divided into its infinite spectrum. There is no such thing as a \"broken family.\" Family is family, and is not determined by marriage certificates, divorce papers, and adoption documents. Families are made in the heart. The only time family becomes null is when those ties in the heart are cut. If you cut those ties, those people are not your family. If you make those ties, those people are your family. And if you hate those ties, those people will still be your family because whatever you hate will always be with you. You\\'re something between a dream and a miracle. Reading is like thinking, like praying, like talking to a friend, like expressing your ideas, like listening to other people\\'s ideas, like listening to music, like looking at the view, like taking a walk on the beach. But if thought corrupts language, language can also corrupt thought. Instructions for living a life. Pay attention. Be astonished. Tell about it. After a good dinner one can forgive anybody, even one\\'s own relations. The role of a writer is not to say what we can all say, but what we are unable to say. Lovers don\\'t finally meet somewhere. They\\'re in each other all along. Fear is a phoenix. You can watch it burn a thousand times and still it will return. It\\'s so much darker when a light goes out than it would have been if it had never shone. My grandmother started walking five miles a day when she was sixty. She\\'s ninety-seven now, and we don\\'t know where the heck she is. The way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing.  Death is so terribly final, while life is full of possibilities. Freedom (n.): To ask nothing. To expect nothing. To depend on nothing. I\\'m going to keep going until I succeed â€ or die. Don\\'t think I don\\'t know how this might end. I\\'ve known it for years. I know some who are constantly drunk on books as other men are drunk on whiskey. If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human faceâ€for ever. Literature is a luxury; fiction is a necessity. If you are a student you should always get a good nights sleep unless you have come to the good part of your book, and then you should stay up all night and let your schoolwork fall by the wayside, a phrase which means \\'flunk\\'. Stars, hide your fires; Let not light see my black and deep desires. We are all born sexual creatures,thank God, but it\\'s a pity so many people despise and crush this natural gift. There is a saying in Tibetan, \\'Tragedy should be utilized as a source of strength.\\'No matter what sort of difficulties, how painful experience is, if we lose our hope, that\\'s our real disaster. It is easy in the world to live after the world\\'s opinion; it is easy in solitude to live after our own; but the great man is he who in the midst of the crowd keeps with perfect sweetness the independence of solitude. Life has no remote....get up and change it yourself! I want to be the friend you fall hopelessly in love with. The one you take into your arms and into your bed and into the private world you keep trapped in your head. I want to be that kind of friend. The one who will memorize the things you say as well as the shape of your lips when you say them. I want to know every curve, every freckle, every shiver of your body. I want to know where to touch you, I want to know how to touch you. I want to know convince you to design a smile just for me. Yes, I do want to be your friend. I want to be your best friend in the entire world. And then I felt sad because I realized that once people are broken in certain ways, they can\\'t ever be fixed, and this is something nobody ever tells you when you are young and it never fails to surprise you as you grow older as you see the people in your life break one by one. You wonder when your turn is going to be, or if it\\'s already happened. Jane, be still; don\\'t struggle so like a wild, frantic bird, that is rending its own plumage in its desperation.\"\"I am no bird; and no net ensnares me; I am a free human being, with an independent will; which I now exert to leave you. Music is ... A higher revelation than all Wisdom & Philosophy When things break, it\\'s not the actual breaking that prevents them from getting back together again. It\\'s because a little piece gets lost - the two remaining ends couldn\\'t fit together even if they wanted to. The whole shape has changed. To lose balance sometimes for love is part of living a balancedlife. Damn, Claire. Warn a guy before you do a face-plant on the floor next time. I could have looked all heroic and caught you or something -Shane We are always the same age inside.  Man often becomes what he believes himself to be. If I keep on saying to myself that I cannot do a certain thing, it is possible that I may end by really becoming incapable of doing it. On the contrary, if I have the belief that I can do it, I shall surely acquire the capacity to do it even if I may not have it at the beginning. Ask for what you want and be prepared to get it! Never leave a friend behind. Friends are all we have to get us through this life--and they are the only things from this world that we could hope to see in the next. It is not the length of life, but the depth. When I\\'m good, I\\'m very good, but when I\\'m bad, I\\'m better.  Others have seen what is and asked why. I have seen what could be and asked why not.  The feelings that hurt most, the emotions that sting most, are those that are absurd - The longing for impossible things, precisely because they are impossible; nostalgia for what never was; the desire for what could have been; regret over not being someone else; dissatisfaction with the worldâ€™s existence. All these half-tones of the soulâ€™s consciousness create in us a painful landscape, an eternal sunset of what we are. I think and think and think, Iâ€˜ve thought myself out of happiness one million times, but never once into it. Holding people away from you, and denying yourself love, that doesn\\'t make you strong. if anything, it makes you weaker. Because you\\'re doing it out of fear. You live like this, sheltered, in a delicate world, and you believe you are living. Then you read a bookâ€¦ or you take a tripâ€¦ and you discover that you are not living, that you are hibernating. The symptoms of hibernating are easily detectable: first, restlessness. The second symptom (when hibernating becomes dangerous and might degenerate into death): absence of pleasure. That is all. It appears like an innocuous illness. Monotony, boredom, death. Millions live like this (or die like this) without knowing it. They work in offices. They drive a car. They picnic with their families. They raise children. And then some shock treatment takes place, a person, a book, a song, and it awakens them and saves them from death. Some never awaken. So we shall let the reader answer this question for himself: who is the happier man, he who has braved the storm of life and lived or he who has stayed securely on shore and merely existed? There is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact. The easy confidence with which I know another man\\'s religion is folly teaches me to suspect that my own is also. Your assumptions are your windows on the world. Scrub them off every once in a while, or the light won\\'t come in. Can you be a girl for a few seconds?\"\"I\\'m always a girl\" I frown.\"You know what I mean. Like a silly, annoying girl\"I twirl my hair around my finger. \"Kay. Sometimes even to live is an act of courage. A concept is a brick. It can be used to build a courthouse of reason. Or it can be thrown through the window. I don\\'t suffer from my insanity -- I enjoy every minute of it. It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen. Help others without any reason and give without the expectation of receiving anything in return. Fairy tales do not tell children the dragons exist. Children already know that dragons exist. Fairy tales tell children the dragons can be killed. One should always be drunk. That\\'s all that matters...But with what? With wine, with poetry, or with virtue, as you chose. But get drunk. It is better to offer no excuse than a bad one. Throw your dreams into space like a kite, and you do not know what it will bring back, a new life, a new friend, a new love, a new country. Life doesn\\'t imitate art, it imitates bad television. Real generosity towards the future lies in giving all to the present. Man, when you lose your laugh you lose your footing. The most authentic thing about us is our capacity to create, to overcome, to endure, to transform, to love and to be greater than our suffering. We rip out so much of ourselves to be cured of things faster than we should that we go bankrupt by the age of thirty and have less to offer each time we start with someone new. But to feel nothing so as not to feel anything - what a waste! I just want to be wonderful. An intellectual? Yes. And never deny it. An intellectual is someone whose mind watches itself. I like this, because I am happy to be both halves, the watcher and the watched. \"Can they be brought together?\" This is a practical question. We must get down to it. \"I despise intelligence\" really means: \"I cannot bear my doubts. I have accepted fear as part of life â€ specifically the fear of change... I have gone ahead despite the pounding in the heart that says: turn back.... Ideally, what should be said to every child, repeatedly, throughout his or her school life is something like this: \\'You are in the process of being indoctrinated. We have not yet evolved a system of education that is not a system of indoctrination. We are sorry, but it is the best we can do. What you are being taught here is an amalgam of current prejudice and the choices of this particular culture. The slightest look at history will show how impermanent these must be. You are being taught by people who have been able to accommodate themselves to a regime of thought laid down by their predecessors. It is a self-perpetuating system. Those of you who are more robust and individual than others will be encouraged to leave and find ways of educating yourself â€ educating your own judgements. Those that stay must remember, always, and all the time, that they are being moulded and patterned to fit into the narrow and particular needs of this particular society. If I should have a daughterâ€¦â€œInstead of â€œMomâ€�, sheâ€™s gonna call me â€œPoint B.â€� Because that way, she knows that no matter what happens, at least she can always find her way to me. And Iâ€™m going to paint the solar system on the back of her hands so that she has to learn the entire universe before she can say â€œOh, I know that like the back of my hand.â€�Sheâ€™s gonna learn that this life will hit you, hard, in the face, wait for you to get back up so it can kick you in the stomach. But getting the wind knocked out of you is the only way to remind your lungs how much they like the taste of air. There is hurt, here, that cannot be fixed by band-aids or poetry, so the first time she realizes that Wonder-woman isnâ€™t coming, Iâ€™ll make sure she knows she doesnâ€™t have to wear the cape all by herself. Because no matter how wide you stretch your fingers, your hands will always be too small to catch all the pain you want to heal. Believe me, Iâ€™ve tried.And â€œBaby,â€� Iâ€™ll tell her â€œdonâ€™t keep your nose up in the air like that, I know that trick, youâ€™re just smelling for smoke so you can follow the trail back to a burning house so you can find the boy who lost everything in the fire to see if you can save him. Or else, find the boy who lit the fire in the first place to see if you can change him.â€�But I know that she will anyway, so instead Iâ€™ll always keep an extra supply of chocolate and rain boats nearby, â€˜cause there is no heartbreak that chocolate canâ€™t fix. Okay, thereâ€™s a few heartbreaks chocolate canâ€™t fix. But thatâ€™s what the rain boots are for, because rain will wash away everything if you let it.I want her to see the world through the underside of a glass bottom boat, to look through a magnifying glass at the galaxies that exist on the pin point of a human mind. Because thatâ€™s how my mom taught me. That thereâ€™ll be days like this, â€œThereâ€™ll be days like this my momma saidâ€� when you open your hands to catch and wind up with only blisters and bruises. When you step out of the phone booth and try to fly and the very people you wanna save are the ones standing on your cape. When your boots will fill with rain and youâ€™ll be up to your knees in disappointment and those are the very days you have all the more reason to say â€œthank you,â€� â€˜cause there is nothing more beautiful than the way the ocean refuses to stop kissing the shoreline no matter how many times itâ€™s sent away.You will put the â€œwindâ€� in win some lose some, you will put the â€œstarâ€� in starting over and over, and no matter how many land mines erupt in a minute be sure your mind lands on the beauty of this funny place called life.And yes, on a scale from one to over-trusting I am pretty damn naive but I want her to know that this world is made out of sugar. It can crumble so easily but donâ€™t be afraid to stick your tongue out and taste it.â€œBaby,â€� Iâ€™ll tell her â€œremember your mama is a worrier but your papa is a warrior and you are the girl with small hands and big eyes who never stops asking for more.â€�Remember that good things come in threes and so do bad things and always apologize when youâ€™ve done something wrong but donâ€™t you ever apologize for the way your eyes refuse to stop shining.Your voice is small but donâ€™t ever stop singing and when they finally hand you heartbreak, slip hatred and war under your doorstep and hand you hand-outs on street corners of cynicism and defeat, you tell them that they really ought to meet your mother. Lord, what fools these mortals be! If we listened to our intellect we\\'d never have a love affair. We\\'d never have a friendship. We\\'d never go in business because we\\'d be cynical: \"It\\'s gonna go wrong.\" Or \"She\\'s going to hurt me.\" Or,\"I\\'ve had a couple of bad love affairs, so therefore . . .\" Well, that\\'s nonsense. You\\'re going to miss life. You\\'ve got to jump off the cliff all the time and build your wings on the way down. When someone you love dies, and you\\'re not expecting it, you don\\'t lose her all at once; you lose her in pieces over a long timeâ€the way the mail stops coming, and her scent fades from the pillows and even from the clothes in her closet and drawers. Gradually, you accumulate the parts of her that are gone. Just when the day comesâ€when there\\'s a particular missing part that overwhelms you with the feeling that she\\'s gone, foreverâ€there comes another day, and another specifically missing part. What is that feeling when you\\'re driving away from people and they recede on the plain till you see their specks dispersing? - it\\'s the too-huge world vaulting us, and it\\'s good-bye. But we lean forward to the next crazy venture beneath the skies. I address you all tonight for who you truly are: wizards, mermaids, travelers, adventurers, and magicians. You are the true dreamers. Hang on, did you just call me Angel?\" I asked.\"If I did?\"\"I don\\'t like it.\"He grinned. \"It stays, Angel. That\\'s the thing about girls. Every time they do something pretty, even if they\\'re not much to look at, or even if they\\'re sort of stupid, you fall in love with them, and then you never know where the hell you are. Girls. Jesus Christ. They can drive you crazy. They really can. You think the dead we loved ever truly leave us? You think that we don\\'t recall them more clearly in times of great trouble? I don\\'t care,\" Clary said. \"He\\'d do it for me. Tell me he wouldn\\'t. If I were missing-\" \"He\\'d burn the whole world down till he could dig you out of the ashes. I know,\" Alec said. Believe in your infinite potential. Your only limitations are those you set upon yourself. You\\'re a guardian angel now.\" I was still too much in awe to wrap my mind around it, but at the same time I felt amazement, curiosity...happiness.\"I\\'m your guardian angel,\" he said.\"I get my very own guardian angel? What, exactly, is your job description?\"\"Guard your body.\" His smile tipped higher. \"I take my job seriously, which means I\\'m going to need to get acquainted with the subject matter on a personal level. Sometimes it takes a good fall to really know where you stand The only person you are destined to become is the person you decide to be. If you want to be happy, be. The unhappiest people in this world, are those who care the most about what other people think. I love you as certain dark things are loved, secretly, between the shadow and the soul. Unfortunately, the clock is ticking, the hours are going by. The past increases, the future recedes. Possibilities decreasing, regrets mounting. The thing I realize is, that it\\'s not what you take, it\\'s what you leave. Poetry is what gets lost in translation. If Peeta and I were both to die, or they thought we were....My fingers fumble with the pouch on my belt, freeing it. Peeta sees it and his hand clamps on my wrist. \"No, I won\\'t let you.\" \"Trust me,\" I whisper. He holds my gaze for a long moment then lets go. I loosen the top of the pouch and pour a few spoonfuls of berries into his palm. Then I fill my own. \"On the count of three?\" Peeta leans down and kisses me once, very gently. \"The count of three,\" he says. We stand, our backs pressed together, our empty hands locked tight. \"Hold them out. I want everyone to see,\" he says. I spread out my fingers, and the dark berries glisten in the sun. I give Peeta\\'s hand one last squeeze as a signal, as a good-bye, and we begin counting. \"One.\" Maybe I\\'m wrong. \"Two.\" Maybe they don\\'t care if we both die. \"Three!\" It\\'s too late to change my mind. I lift my hand to my mouth taking one last look at the world. The berries have just passed my lips when the trumpets begin to blare. The frantic voice of Claudius Templesmith shouts above them. \"Stop! Stop! Ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to present the victors of the 74th Hunger Games, Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark! I give you - the tributes of District 12! It crosses my mind that Cinna\\'s calm and normal demeanor masks a complete madman. Do not train a child to learn by force or harshness; but direct them to it by what amuses their minds, so that you may be better able to discover with accuracy the peculiar bent of the genius of each. When you consider things like the stars, our affairs don\\'t seem to matter very much, do they? Maybe there were people who lived those lives. Maybe this girl was one of them. But what about the rest of us? What about the nobodies and the nothings, the invisible girls? We learn to hold our heads as if we wear crowns. We learn to wring magic from the ordinary. That was how you survived when you werenâ€™t chosen, when there was no royal blood in your veins. When the world owed you nothing, you demanded something of it anyway. I will love you as a thief loves a gallery and as a crow loves a murder, as a cloud loves bats and as a range loves braes. I will love you as misfortune loves orphans, as fire loves innocence and as justice loves to sit and watch while everything goes wrong. I will love you as a battlefield loves young men and as peppermints love your allergies, and I will love you as the banana peel loves the shoe of a man who was just struck by a shingle falling off a house. I will love you as a volunteer fire department loves rushing into burning buildings and as burning buildings love to chase them back out, and as a parachute loves to leave a blimp and as a blimp operator loves to chase after it.I will love you as a dagger loves a certain personâ€™s back, and as a certain person loves to wear dagger proof tunics, and as a dagger proof tunic loves to go to a certain dry cleaning facility, and how a certain employee of a dry cleaning facility loves to stay up late with a pair of binoculars, watching a dagger factory for hours in the hopes of catching a burglar, and as a burglar loves sneaking up behind people with binoculars, suddenly realizing that she has left her dagger at home. I will love you as a drawer loves a secret compartment, and as a secret compartment loves a secret, and as a secret loves to make a person gasp, and as a gasping person loves a glass of brandy to calm their nerves, and as a glass of brandy loves to shatter on the floor, and as the noise of glass shattering loves to make someone else gasp, and as someone else gasping loves a nearby desk to lean against, even if leaning against it presses a lever that loves to open a drawer and reveal a secret compartment. I will love you until all such compartments are discovered and opened, and until all the secrets have gone gasping into the world. I will love you until all the codes and hearts have been broken and until every anagram and egg has been unscrambled.I will love you until every fire is extinguised and until every home is rebuilt from the handsomest and most susceptible of woods, and until every criminal is handcuffed by the laziest of policemen. I will love until M. hates snakes and J. hates grammar, and I will love you until C. realizes S. is not worthy of his love and N. realizes he is not worthy of the V. I will love you until the bird hates a nest and the worm hates an apple, and until the apple hates a tree and the tree hates a nest, and until a bird hates a tree and an apple hates a nest, although honestly I cannot imagine that last occurrence no matter how hard I try. I will love you as we grow older, which has just happened, and has happened again, and happened several days ago, continuously, and then several years before that, and will continue to happen as the spinning hands of every clock and the flipping pages of every calendar mark the passage of time, except for the clocks that people have forgotten to wind and the calendars that people have forgotten to place in a highly visible area. I will love you as we find ourselves farther and farther from one another, where we once we were so close that we could slip the curved straw, and the long, slender spoon, between our lips and fingers respectively.I will love you until the chances of us running into one another slip from slim to zero, and until your face is fogged by distant memory, and your memory faced by distant fog, and your fog memorized by a distant face, and your distance distanced by the memorized memory of a foggy fog. I will love you no matter where you go and who you see, no matter where you avoid and who you donâ€™t see, and no matter who sees you avoiding where you go. I will love you no matter what happens to you, and no matter how I discover what happens to you, and no matter what happens to me as I discover this, and now matter how I am discovered after what happens to me as I am discovering this. This is how it works. I love the people in my life, and I do for my friends whatever they need me to do for them, again and again, as many times as is necessary. For example, in your case you always forgot who you are and how much you\\'re loved. So what I do for you as your friend is remind you who you are and tell you how much I love you. And this isn\\'t any kind of burden for me, because I love who you are very much. Every time I remind you, I get to remember with you, which is my pleasure. I didnâ€™t go to religion to make me happy. I always knew a bottle of Port would do that. If you want a religion to make you feel really comfortable, I certainly donâ€™t recommend Christianity. The starting point of all achievement is DESIRE. Keep this constantly in mind. Weak desire brings weak results, just as a small fire makes a small amount of heat. Listen with curiosity. Speak with honesty. Act with integrity. The greatest problem with communication is we donâ€™t listen to understand. We listen to reply. When we listen with curiosity, we donâ€™t listen with the intent to reply. We listen for whatâ€™s behind the words. Happiness is not the absence of problems, it\\'s the ability to deal with them. When he died, all things soft and beautiful and bright would be buried with him. He is half of my soul, as the poets say. When we are children we seldom think of the future. This innocence leaves us free to enjoy ourselves as few adults can. The day we fret about the future is the day we leave our childhood behind. Spring is the time of plans and projects. And then I am going to rattle the stars. I\\'ve begun to realize that you can listen to silence and learn from it. It has a quality and a dimension all its own. But-\" Maia, still looking at Alec and Magnus, broke off and rasied her eyebrows. Simon turned to see what she was looking at - and stared.Alec had his arms around Magnus and was kissing him full on the mouth. Magnus, who appeared to be in a state of shock, stood frozen. Several groups of people - Shadowhunters and Downworlders alike - were staring and whispering. Glancing to the side, Simon saw the Lightwoods, their eyes widen, gaping at the display. Maryse had her hand over her mouth.Maia looked perplexed. \"Wait a second,\" she said. \"Do we all have to do that, too? People, generally, suck. Peace cannot be kept by force; it can only be achieved by understanding. Youâ€™re in a car with a beautiful boy, and he wonâ€™t tell you that he loves you, but he loves you. And you feel like youâ€™ve done something terrible, like robbed a liquor store, or swallowed pills, or shoveled yourself a grave in the dirt, and youâ€™re tired. Youâ€™re in a car with a beautiful boy, and youâ€™re trying not to tell him that you love him, and youâ€™re trying to choke down the feeling, and youâ€™re trembling, but he reaches over and he touches you, like a prayer for which no words exist, and you feel your heart taking root in your body, like youâ€™ve discovered something you didnâ€™t even have a name for. What else? She is so beautiful. You donâ€™t get tired of looking at her. You never worry if she is smarter than you: You know she is. She is funny without ever being mean. I love her. I am so lucky to love her, Van Houten. You donâ€™t get to choose if you get hurt in this world, old man, but you do have some say in who hurts you. I like my choices. I hope she likes hers. People think it must be fun to be a super genius, but they don\\'t realize how hard it is to put up with all the idiots in the world. We need to talk. All of us About what we\\'re going to do now.\"\"I was going to watch Project Runway. If you win, you need not have to explain...If you lose, you should not be there to explain! My only love sprung from my only hate!Too early seen unknown, and known too late!Prodigious birth of love it is to me,That I must love a loathed enemy. Grown-ups never understand anything by themselves, and it is tiresome for children to be always and forever explaining things to them This is what we call love. When you are loved, you can do anything in creation. When you are loved, there\\'s no need at all to understand what\\'s happening, because everything happens within you. Black hair and blue eyes are my favorite combination. There is no point treating a depressed person as though she were just feeling sad, saying, \\'There now, hang on, you\\'ll get over it.\\' Sadness is more or less like a head cold- with patience, it passes. Depression is like cancer. Sebastian just smiled. â€œI could hear your heart beating,â€� he said softly. â€œWhen you were watching me with Valentine. Did it bother you?â€�â€œThat you seem to be dating my dad?â€� Jace shrugged. \"Youâ€™re a little young for him, to be honest.â€�â€œWhat?â€� For the first time since Jace had met him, Sebastian seemed flabbergasted. Your emotions are the slaves to your thoughts, and you are the slave to your emotions. I don\\'t hate you.. I just don\\'t like that you exist I don\\'t want to be married just to be married. I can\\'t think of anything lonelier than spending the rest of my life with someone I can\\'t talk to, or worse, someone I can\\'t be silent with. I figured all your classes were stuff like Slaughter 101 and Beheading for Beginners.\"Jace flipped a page. \"Very funny, Fray. I just want you to know that youâ€™re very specialâ€¦ and the only reason Iâ€™m telling you is that I donâ€™t know if anyone else ever has. Poetry is what happens when nothing else can. A trap is only a trap if you don\\'t know about it. If you know about it, it\\'s a challenge. We live as we dream--alone.... No one is useless in this world who lightens the burdens of another. Moths,\" repeats Will. \"You\\'re afraid of moths?\" \"Not just a cloud of moths,\" she says, \"like...a swarm of them. Everywhere. All those wings and legs and...\" She shudders and shakes her head.\"Terrifying,\" Will says with mock seriousness. \"That\\'s my girl. Tough as cotton balls.\"\"Oh, Shut up. The soul is healed by being with children. Clary felt suddenly annoyed. \"When the self-congratulatory part of the evening is over, maybe we could get back to saving my best friend from being exsanguinated to death?\"\"Exsanguinated,\" said Jace, impressed. \"That\\'s a big word.\"\"And you\\'re a big-\"\"Tsk tsk,\" he interupted. \"No swearing in church. Ù…Ø´ Ù…Ù‡Ù… Ø§Ù†Ùƒ ØªØºÙŠØ± Ø§Ù„ÙƒÙˆÙ†... Ø§Ù„Ù…Ù‡Ù… Ø§Ù†Ùƒ ØªØ®Ù„ÙŠ Ø§Ù„ÙƒÙˆÙ† Ù…Ø§ ÙŠØºÙŠØ±ÙƒØ´ Laugh, even when you feel too sick or too worn out or tired. Smile, even when you\\'re trying not to cry and the tears are blurring your vision. Sing, even when people stare at you and tell you your voice is crappy. Trust, even when your heart begs you not to. Twirl, even when your mind makes no sense of what you see. Frolick, even when you are made fun of. Kiss, even when others are watching. Sleep, even when you\\'re afraid of what the dreams might bring. Run, even when it feels like you can\\'t run any more.And, always, remember, even when the memories pinch your heart. Because the pain of all your experience is what makes you the person you are now. And without your experience---you are an empty page, a blank notebook, a missing lyric. What makes you brave is your willingness to live through your terrible life and hold your head up high the next day. So don\\'t live life in fear. Because you are stronger now, after all the crap has happened, than you ever were back before it started. If everybody minded their own business, the world would go around a great deal faster than it does. If you don\\'t go after what you want, you\\'ll never have it. If you don\\'t ask, the answer is always no. If you don\\'t step forward, you\\'re always in the same place. Tiger got to hunt, bird got to fly;Man got to sit and wonder \\'why, why, why?\\'Tiger got to sleep, bird got to land;Man got to tell himself he understand. That\\'s what fiction is for. It\\'s for getting at the truth when the truth isn\\'t sufficient for the truth. If we have no peace, it is because we have forgotten that we belong to each other. In times of grief and sorrow I will hold you and rock you and take your grief and make it my own. When you cry I cry and when you hurt I hurt. And together we will try to hold back the floods to tears and despair and make it through the potholed street of life Each night, when I go to sleep, I die. And the next morning, when I wake up, I am reborn. You know it\\'s never fifty-fifty in a marriage. It\\'s always seventy-thirty, or sixty-forty. Someone falls in love first. Someone puts someone else up on a pedestal. Someone works very hard to keep things rolling smoothly; someone else sails along for the ride. The bird, the pin, the song, the berries, the watch, the cracker, the dress that burst into flames. I am the mockingjay. The one that survived despite the Capitol\\'s plans. The symbol of the rebellion. Dare to live the life you have dreamed for yourself. Go forward and make your dreams come true. I hope you find someone you can\\'t live without.I really do. And I hope you never have to know what it\\'s like to have to try and live without them. Demons run when a good man goes to warNight will fall and drown the sunWhen a good man goes to warFriendship dies and true love liesNight will fall and the dark will riseWhen a good man goes to warDemons run, but count the costThe battle\\'s won, but the child is lost If you try to fail, and succeed, which have you done? Listen to them, the children of the night. What music they make! Hello, Harry\" said George, beaming at him. \"We thought we heard your dulcet tones.\"\"You don\\'t want to bottle up your anger like that, Harry, let it all out,\" said Fred, also beaming. \"There might be a couple of people fifty miles away who didn\\'t hear you. The grand essentials to happiness in this life are something to do, something to love, and something to hope for. We are all born mad. Some remain so. Whatever you do, you need courage. Whatever course you decide upon, there is always someone to tell you that you are wrong. There are always difficulties arising that tempt you to believe your critics are right. To map out a course of action and follow it to an end requires some of the same courage that a soldier needs. Peace has its victories, but it takes brave men and women to win them. If my doctor told me I had only six minutes to live, I wouldn\\'t brood. I\\'d type a little faster. Half the world is composed of people who have something to say and can\\'t, and the other half who have nothing to say and keep on saying it. But Dumbledore says he doesn\\'t care what they do as long as they don\\'t take him off the Chocolate Frog cards. It\\'s so strange how life works: You want something and you wait and wait and feel like it\\'s taking forever to come. Then it happens and it\\'s over and all you want to do is curl back up in that moment before things changed. If he loved with all the powers of his puny being, he couldn\\'t love as much in eighty years as I could in a day. Yes, we praise women over 40 for a multitude of reasons. Unfortunately, it\\'s not reciprocal. For every stunning, smart, well-coiffed, hot woman over 40, there is a bald, paunchy relic in yellow pants making a fool of himself with some 22-year old waitress. Ladies, I apologize. For all those men who say, \"Why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free?\", here\\'s an update for you. Nowadays 80% of women are against marriage. Why? Because women realize it\\'s not worth buying an entire pig just to get a little sausage! See, the problem is that God gives men a brain and a penis, and only enough blood to run one at a time. A question that sometimes drives me hazy: am I or are the others crazy? The worst thing about new books is that they keep us from reading the old ones. None of us knows what might happen even the next minute, yet still we go forward. Because we trust. Because we have faith. Dreams are the touchstones of our characters. The past beats inside me like a second heart. The VoiceThere is a voice inside of youThat whispers all day long,\"I feel this is right for me,I know that this is wrong.\"No teacher, preacher, parent, friendOr wise man can decideWhat\\'s right for you--just listen toThe voice that speaks inside. It is often in the darkest skies that we see the brightest stars. if you love two people at the same time, choose the second. Because if you really loved the first one, you wouldn\\'t have fallen for the second. No matter how plain a woman may be, if truth and honesty are written across her face, she will be beautiful. All right,\" said Susan. \"I\\'m not stupid. You\\'re saying humans need... fantasies to make life bearable.\"REALLY? AS IF IT WAS SOME KIND OF PINK PILL? NO. HUMANS NEED FANTASY TO BE HUMAN.

AND YET YOU ACT AS IF THERE IS SOME IDEAL ORDER IN THE WORLD, AS IF THERE IS SOME...SOME RIGHTNESS IN THE UNIVERSE BY WHICH IT MAY BE JUDGED.\"Yes, but people have got to believe that, or what\\'s the pointâ€\"MY POINT EXACTLY. My wish is that you may be loved to the point of madness. In the end that was the choice you made, and it doesn\\'t matter how hard it was to make it. It matters that you did. The difference between sex and love is that sex relieves tension and love causes it. Be steady and well-ordered in your life so that you can be fierce and original in your work. sex is the consolation you have when you can\\'t have love Whatever you can do or dream you can, begin it.Boldness has genius, power and magic in it! I am a part of all that I have met. Today is the sort of day where the sun only comes up to humiliate you. I sought to hear the voice of God and climbed the topmost steeple, but God declared: \"Go down again - I dwell among the people. Stepping onto a brand-new path is difficult, but not more difficult than remaining in a situation, which is not nurturing to the whole woman. Morality is simply the attitude we adopt towards people we personally dislike. Don\\'t aim at success. The more you aim at it and make it a target, the more you are going to miss it. For success, like happiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensue, and it only does so as the unintended side effect of one\\'s personal dedication to a cause greater than oneself or as the by-product of one\\'s surrender to a person other than oneself. Happiness must happen, and the same holds for success: you have to let it happen by not caring about it. I want you to listen to what your conscience commands you to do and go on to carry it out to the best of your knowledge. Then you will live to see that in the long-runâ€in the long-run, I say!â€success will follow you precisely because you had forgotten to think about it In life, finding a voice is speaking and living the truth. Each of you is an original. Each of you has a distinctive voice. When you find it, your story will be told. You will be heard. Winter is the time for comfort, for good food and warmth, for the touch of a friendly hand and for a talk beside the fire: it is the time for home. Silence is so freaking loud'"
